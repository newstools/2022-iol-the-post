DURBAN - A man was killed in a freak accident on Monday when the loading platform of a trailer fell on his head. Midlands EMS said that at 11.25am, Midlands EMS Pietermaritzburg crews were dispatched to Albert Falls, north of Pietermaritzburg, for a workplace accident. Midlands EMS said that when crews arrived they were met by another private service that had arrived just prior to their crews. “Our crews found a single patient about 50 years of age, who was in a critical condition after the loading platform of a trailer had come loose and landed on the gentleman’s head,” Midlands EMS said. “After a lengthy time on scene after performing a full resuscitation, the patient sadly died.” Last month a man in Bothas Hill, west of Durban, drove over his foot while cutting the lawn, leaving him with a partial amputation of his foot. The man was stabilised and was flown by Netcare 911 helicopter to hospital. Daily News
