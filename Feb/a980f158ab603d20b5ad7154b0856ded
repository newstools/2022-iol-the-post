DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela has condemned the burning of a library in Ezakheni in the Alfred Duma Local Municipality in northern KZN, on Tuesday morning. This will also impact the commemoration of the 13th annual World Read Aloud Day. Mavimbela visited the library to assess the damage and also engage with the library’s staff. Damages to the library include burnt computers, chairs, shelves, air-conditioners and books. “It is quite sad to see such damage caused in a facility which is supposed to be helping our communities. This library, which is the only one in Ezakheni, services at least 30 schools, one TVET College, and four other surrounding wards in Mcitsheni and St Chads,” Mavimbela said. “We would like to plead with our communities to protect government buildings such as libraries as they are meant to be helping our communities. We also call upon anyone who can help to identify these perpetrators to come forward and work with law-enforcement to ensure that these people are caught.” Mavimbela said the burning of the library came at a time when the Department of Arts and Culture was commemorating the 13th annual World Read Aloud Day. This year’s Nal’ibali will be celebrated with a new special story, A Party at the Park by Mabel Mnensa. “What saddens us more is that, the children of Ezakheni instead of celebrating with the rest of the world and participating in the World Read Aloud Day, they woke up to a burnt library, Mavimbela said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said it was alleged the incident was at 05.48am on Tuesday. Gwala said when police arrived at the scene they noticed the library was on fire and the windows, computers, aircon, books and book shelves were damaged. “A case of malicious damage to property was opened at Ezakheni police station for investigation,” Gwala said.
