Durban - Marshall Security said a Toyota Fortuner stolen outside the owner’s property in Umdloti today was recovered within 30 minutes of ground teams being deployed to track it down Marshall Security, Tyron Powell, said just after 7am this morning a member of the public flagged down its dedicated Umdloti Smart Village Armed Response Vehicle on Bellamont Road. He said the person advised the armed response officers that their white Toyota Fortuner had been stolen from outside their premises just a few minutes earlier. “The details of the vehicle were immediately circulated by our Emergency Dispatch Centre to all armed Response Officers and Special Operation Team members,”he said. Powell said after it was determined that the vehicle was fitted with a Tracker SA device, members of the Special Operations Team were immediately activated to assist them in locating it. “Within half-an-hour of tracking, the stolen vehicle was found abandoned in the Ntuzuma B Section area, still idling,” he said. He said the vehicle was successfully recovered by members of the Special Operations Team, Tracker SA and Durban North SAPS Rapid Response team. “The suspects were nowhere to be seen,” said Powell. Powell said this was the second tracking deployment for the week. “The first led ground teams to a chop shop in Amatikwe, where the stolen vehicle had been completely stripped mere hours after being taken,” he said.
