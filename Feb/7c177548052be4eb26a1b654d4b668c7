DURBAN - After the devastating Covid-19 pandemic that claimed lives and prevented many from generating an income, Durban-based Friends of South African Comedy are bringing people together for cheerful evenings of laughter and entertainment. The company’s director, Cassandra Garafallou told the Daily News that she is taking comedy to the people, bringing the Mainou's On Tour show to venues in KZN.  “The past two years have been a very difficult period; our beautiful province of KZN took a hard knock during the unrest, and many lives were lost. We put together this tour in honour of all those we lost. “As we hit the road we are hoping to see people coming together and sharing a burst of laughter again. This will be one for the books ... three things which will be guaranteed in those shows is a lot of laughing, good music and dancing.” Garafallou said that the show will be hosted in more than 10 towns across KZN over a three-week period -  journeying to, among others, the North Coast, South Coast, and inland parts of the province. Acts included Carvin H Goldstone and comedian Andrew Hughes, who is known for his Laarnie videos on social media. “Hip hop artists TRO - Chuckie and Paul  - who have been in the comedy industry for over 20 years, will bring back memories for all with their famous hits such as Hey Owens, with so much more, together with some DJs to bring some good tunes.” Popular local comedians Monde Blose and Mangaliso Mlongo are among the big names on the tour.  Garafallou said her company is working with young people of all races to identify talent, and develop and empower them.
