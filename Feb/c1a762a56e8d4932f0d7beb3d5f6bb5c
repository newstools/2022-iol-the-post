DURBAN - A popular butchery in Springfield Park was robbed by a group of armed suspects on Wednesday. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the robbery occurred just after 4pm. Mbele said a security guard, who is employed by the butchery on Intersite Avenue, was on duty when he was approached by a man who pointed a firearm at him. She said the suspect ordered the security guard not to move. “Another three males immediately showed up and entered the store, where they held the staff up at gunpoint,” said Mbele. Mbele said the suspects then ordered the staff to open the tills. “An undisclosed amount of cash was taken, and no injuries occurred,” she said. Police said a case of business robbery was opened at Sydenham SAPS. Earlier this year, The Mercury reported that robbers were spooked by an alarm and fled a business in Springfield Park during an attempted robbery. Police said three suspects allegedly entered the shop and demanded that the complainant open the safe. An alarm went off, and the suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle, leaving a backpack with 25 rounds of ammunition. Last year, a group of armed men killed an employee and a security guard during a business robbery on Londonderry Crescent in Springfield.  THE MERCURY
