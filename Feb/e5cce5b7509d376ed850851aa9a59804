THE City of uMhlathuze hosted its first three-day Business Expo 2022 and drew more than 1 000 patrons.  The expo provided an opportunity for Small Medium and Macro Enterprises (SMMEs), entrepreneurs and local businesses to exhibit their products and services. The expo, which was held from February 16 to 18 in Richards Bay, was opened by City of uMhlathuze Mayor Xolani Ngwezi and Deputy Minister of Trade Industry and Economic Development Nomalungelo Gina.  The city said the expo attracted 34 exhibitors spanning the industrial sector, agricultural sector, health and safety sector, information technology and innovation sector, tourism sector as well as government departments and state-owned enterprises. “We are very excited that this initiative was successful and it seemingly produced results that we were aiming for - to create a platform for engagement between the informal sector, industries and potential funders. Our wish is to grow this project to be an annual event,” said Ngwezi. Deputy mayor Nkululeko Ngubane encouraged SMMEs to seize all opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. “Companies who are ignoring diversification are dying a slow death. We know it is difficult but try hard to be relevant. We are here as the city to try and uplift and support you through such initiatives. Giving up is not an option. Thrive hard to succeed,” he said.
