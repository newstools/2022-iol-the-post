DURBAN - The MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal, Kwazi Mshengu has called on parents and guardians to register their children early or on time for the 2023 academic year, to avoid the late registration that happens every January. The department stated that over the years it had found itself having to deal with issues of learner admissions due to late registration by parents and guardians at the start of the academic year, instead of starting teaching and learning in earnest on the first day of school. It further said that late admissions also led to some schools becoming overcrowded as there was pressure to get pupils into class. According to the South African Schools Act, every pupil should be in school. Mshengu said: “As the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal, we urge parents to heed this call of early registration of learners. This will assist the system, especially our educators to have ample time to sharpen our learners and secure a bright future for them as well as the nation,” he said. In preparation for 2023, parents are urged to enrol pupils for entry into grades 1 to 8 starting from Tuesday, March 1, to September 30, 2022. Parents are advised to apply to a minimum of three schools in order to ensure that they secure places for their children. This will increase the chances of pupils being placed in one of them, be it the second or third choice. The department further advises parents to check their progress three months after making an application. Daily News
