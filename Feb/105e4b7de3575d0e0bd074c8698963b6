Durban - A Reaction Unit South Africa(Rusa) officer was flown to a specialist medical facility after he was seriously wounded in a shooting while attending to an alarm activation at the industrial park in Pinetown this morning. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the incident took place just before 12.30am on Shepstone Road. Herbst said reports indicate that an armed reaction officer had been ambushed while investigating an alarm activation. “A gunfight had broken out between multiple armed robbers and the reaction officer as he approached the property. “The patient, an adult male in his thirties, had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body,” he said. He said the man was in a critical condition “clinging to life” and was stabilised before being taken to hospital. “Once treated, the patient was flown by Netcare 911 helicopter ambulance to a specialist facility for continuation of care,” said Herbst. Last year, The Mercury’s sister publication the Daily News reported that an ET Rapid Response officer was shot during a shootout with robbers on South Coast Road in Clairwood while attending to a panic activation. ET Rapid Response managing director Tony Lokker said their emergency control centre had received a panic activation from a service station and dispatched armed response units. Lokker said upon arrival of the first response officer, he was met by a hail of gunfire, as six suspects were busy robbing the store. THE MERCURY
