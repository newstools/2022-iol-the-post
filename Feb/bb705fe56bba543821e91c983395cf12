DURBAN – uShaka Sea World’s first turtle release of the year was marked by the release of two green turtles, Hela and Calypso, in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on Thursday, having spent time in the care of uShaka Sea World staff. uShaka Sea World said release day was every rehabilitation specialist's favourite day and Thursday was one of those days. Hela arrived on August 26, 2021, after being found upside down on a Zinkwazi beach. She was diagnosed with a severe internal infection causing her to expel blood through her nostrils when diving. She was treated and allowed plenty of time to rest in a shallow pool which allowed her lungs time to heal. Calypso was found 10km inland in a pedestrian’s rucksack by a farmer on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast four years ago. Calypso had been caught with a hook that was internally lodged and visible on radiograph. Fishing hooks can cause extensive damage internally, but they can also pass safely through a turtle’s system. Calypso, fortunately, made a full recovery. Aquarist Lindani Kwela who has worked with Calypso since her arrival said: “I am overcome with emotion, helping them is always so rewarding. Release day is exciting but also a little sad because I am not sure what she will face in the wild.” Aquarist Ryan Rambaran, who also worked with the turtles, said: “Working with turtles and being part of their rehabilitation journey is a privilege. Although Hela's journey was tough in the beginning, we are so excited that she is now fit and healthy enough for release.” Daily News
