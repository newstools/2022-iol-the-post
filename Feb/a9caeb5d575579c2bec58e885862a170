DURBAN – The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has called for support in its efforts to help Ukrainian animal shelters. The NSPCA said on Friday that it was devastated as news of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine unfolded. “Our hearts go out to our colleagues in animal welfare and the people of Ukraine,” the NSPCA said. “The NSPCA will be donating R30 000 as a starting point toward relief efforts for animal welfare shelters in Ukraine.” “The NSPCA commends our brave colleagues working at animal welfare shelters in Ukraine, who have decided to stay behind and care for the animals living at their shelters. These animals have nowhere to go,” the NSPCA said. It said it was liaising with colleagues overseas to establish legitimate routes for donations to be provided in a way that would benefit as many Ukrainian animal welfare shelters as possible. “South Africa, we are known to the world because of our spirit of ubuntu, among many other wonderful things. We cannot stand by and do nothing!” the NSPCA said. How to donate: Meanwhile, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said the cat in the picture was carried by a refugee looking for shelter more than 60km from the war zone. “Peta Germany provided them both with necessary care and supplies.” “Humans and animals stuck in Ukraine are debilitated and frightened – they need all the support they can get,” Peta said.
