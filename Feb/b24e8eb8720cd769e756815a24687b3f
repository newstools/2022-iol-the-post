DURBAN - No one has identified the two men who were found with multiple gunshot wounds in a vehicle on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast last Thursday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Ezinqoleni SAPS were investigating a case of murder after two men were found dead in a vehicle at Mbeni area in Ezinqoleni on Thursday at about 5pm. “Both victims, believed to be in their late thirties, had sustained several gunshot wounds to the body and were declared dead on the scene,” Mbele said. She said the motive for the killing was unknown. “The victims are still unknown,” Mbele said. KwaZulu Private Ambulance (KZPA) said it responded to reports of a collision on the N2. “When emergency services arrived, they found two adult male occupants in a bakkie had sustained multiple fatal gunshot wounds,” KZPA said. “Paramedics quickly assessed the patients and found they had succumbed to their injuries before emergency services arrived.” That was the second shooting in the South Coast area two days in a row. On Wednesday, police spokesperson Mbele said Margate police were investigating a case of murder after a 33-year-old man, while in his vehicle on a national road in Margate near a taxi rank, was shot by an unknown gunman. He had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body and was declared dead at the scene. Netcare 911 had responded to a shooting outside a hardware store off the R620 in Margate. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said medics assessed the scene and found that the driver, a man, had sustained fatal injuries after being shot multiple times. A passenger, a woman, sustained a minor graze to her left leg and was treated at the scene. Daily News
