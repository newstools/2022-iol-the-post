DURBAN - THE three-day KwaZulu-Natal Industrial Technology Exhibition which started yesterday is set to stimulate business trade in the province. The exhibition is being held at the Durban Exhibition Centre. Gary Corin, managing director of Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery, which organised the exhibition, said that after two years of businesses not being able to interact with each other because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the event was a good opportunity for them to build relations and network. “This is about meeting face to face and seeing things, experimenting with the machines. This is like a shopping mall for businesses, there are competitors and a whole lot of different industry sectors under one roof,” he said. Corin said that over the past years there have been partnerships and deals made between businesses because of the exhibition. Lyndall Farrer, marketing manager for Dromex, a wholesaler which supplies personal protective equipment and safety products, said they want their customers to meet them and get advice from their technical experts. “This is a great chance for brand awareness and having our customers come talk to us for advice and get to experience and feel our products,” she said. Technical sales engineer Gerhard van Grenuen from Klüber Lubrication, a brand of the Freudenberg Group which supplies tailor-made lubricants, said the business was recovering well from the pandemic. “The business has been affected by Covid-19 as has the rest of the sectors, but since last year it has been coming back to normal. Since the beginning of 2022 the business has been expanding and growing quite a lot,” he said.  Sydney Lekobotja, a spare parts co-ordinator at ELGi, which designs and manufactures compressed air solutions, said the company was looking into establishing a branch in Durban.  “We are hoping that by the time the exhibition ends we would have met more people and they would have seen and learnt about our products,” he said.
