DURBAN - Wentworth SAPS are investigating charges of murder and attempted murder after two men were shot, leaving one dead. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said it was alleged that at 12.15am on Sunday, two men were shot by unknown suspects who were travelling in a vehicle on Major Calvert Road in Wentworth, south of Durban. "A 36-year-old man was shot in the neck and was declared dead at the scene. The deceased’s friend was grazed by bullets on the buttocks," Mbele said.
