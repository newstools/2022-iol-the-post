DURBAN -  eThekwini Municipality deputy mayor Philani Mavundla has warned residents not to fall for a scam by a person who is using his name and picture on social networks promising jobs.  The deputy mayor said there was a person on Facebook who goes by the name Philani Mavundla who posted cleaning job opportunities, adding that the person used his name in his profile to look like he is Mavundla, the deputy mayor. The deputy mayor wrote on his Facebook page on Saturday and warned people that the account was fake. “People please be extra careful, there is a bogus Philani Mavundla on Facebook claiming all sorts of things in my name. This is not my account and I have since notified all city officials including law-enforcement agencies to deal with this person and his/ her criminal acts. I only have one Facebook account/page that exists and only 1 Instagram account. I would never advertise any city jobs or opportunities through these media platforms - in actual fact, that is not how we operate in the municipality. Please refrain from engaging with this criminal using my name in a dirty manner,” read the deputy mayor post. In Facebook Mavundla goes by the name councillor PG Mavundla. He uses this page to communicate the work he is doing for eThekwini residents as chair of the Human Settlement and Infrastructure committee. His portfolio includes water and sanitation as well as refuse collection. He is the president of Abantu Batho Congress which has two seats in the municipality.  His party helped ANC to retain the city and he was rewarded with a deputy mayor position. To comment on this story send a WhatsApp message to our Backchat column on 071 485 7995. Daily News
