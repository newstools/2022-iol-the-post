DURBAN – A week after floods hit the town of Utrecht in KwaZulu-Natal, municipal officials assured eMadlangeni Municipality mayor Mzwakhe Buthelezi that repair work to restore water to the communities of White City and Bensdorp were 80% complete. This comes after the mayor, accompanied by the wards 2 and 5 councillors NM Dekker and SM Khoza respectively, held a community meeting with residents who were concerned about the delay in the repairs. In a statement on Friday, the municipality said the mayor was also joined by senior officials from both eMadlangeni and Amajuba municipalities. “The meeting took place due to the long delay in restoration of the water supply to the communities of White City and Bensdorp, after the tragic severe recent storms that led to major flooding in the town of Utrecht and surrounding areas,” said the municipality.   The municipality said the inefficiency of the coordination of the water tankers dispatched to mitigate the water-supply challenges was also raised by the community. “The mayor confirmed to the residents that he has engaged with various stakeholders which include the mayor and senior officials of Amajuba District, as well as officials from the technical services department have been assigned to urgently attend to repairs to the damaged infrastructure,” said their statement. According to the municipality, officials also assured residents that a service provider has been appointed and was working around the clock to ensure that water is restored soon. “The office of the mayor will be monitoring the progress, and provide regular feedback to the community and the various stakeholders,” said the municipality. An update posted on the municipality’s Facebook page on Saturday stated that Buthelezi had conducted a site visit to Mpongoza bridge to assess developments on restoring the water supply to White City and Bensdorp.
