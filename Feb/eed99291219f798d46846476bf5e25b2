DURBAN - THE DA in KwaZulu-Natal plans to lodge a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission over the squalid living conditions that thousands of people that live in the KwaMathe Transit Camp near Lamontville-Durban are subjected to. The party said it had been informed by residents that there are about 3000 people that are forced to live in squalor at the camp, some of them have been there for more than five years. “In this area, there are no human rights in the way the people are living, and that is why we will be reporting the matter to the Human Rights Commission,”said DA leader Francois Rodgers. Rodgers spent two nights sleeping in the camp in an effort to highlight the inequalities and the plight faced by residents, and he detailed his experience. “I came here to visit the area, and I returned to get a sense of how people live.”  He said he understood that some of the people in the camp ended up there after the informal settlement they were residing in was damaged by the storm. “We who live in the suburban areas take it for granted that we could walk into the next room and have a shower. That is not the condition here,” he said. People have to walk to communal ablution facilities where only one shower is working, and they have to stand in the queue to take a shower. There is no hot water in that one working shower, which is also being used by the entire community by men, women and children, he said. “You have to walk almost a kilometre for a place to wash dishes, and it is extremely hot in these corrugated iron rooms,” he said. He said he would be engaging with the provincial government to intervene, “the community there was welcoming ( to me being there), but they are angry at the empty promises from the government. They are angry that they were promised houses that have not been delivered,” he said.   THE MERCURY
