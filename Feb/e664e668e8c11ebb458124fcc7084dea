DURBAN - The IFP has congratulated and welcomed two new members of its parliamentary caucus.  Mkhuleko Hlengwa, member of parliament and  IFP national spokesperson, said that the party had welcomed Sanele Zondo and  Nhlanhla Hadebe as the newest members of the IFP parliamentary caucus. Hlengwa said Zondo, who is currently the IFP Youth Brigade (IFPYB) deputy national chairperson, will be filling the vacancy left by the late Mthokozisi Nxumalo in the National Assembly.  Nxumalo served in the National Assembly from May 2019 until his death in a car accident in Nongoma in August 2021.  “We are confident that Zondo, like his predecessor, will boldly represent the youth of South Africa and champion the issues that impact their daily lives.” Hlengwa said that Hadebe would be representing the IFP in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP).  “He takes over from Xolani Ngwezi, who was redeployed from NCOP to take up the position of Mayor of uMhlathuze Local Municipality.” He said Hadebe had held various roles in local government, as well as positions in the IFPYB and various other IFP governance structures, including in the National Executive Committee and KZN Provincial Executive Committee. Hlengwa added that the IFP wished both members well as they embarked upon the next chapter and that both Zondo and Hadebe would be sworn in as councillors shortly. “In keeping with due process, their names have been submitted to Parliament, and the protocols for their swearing in as MPs will follow shortly.” THE MERCURY
