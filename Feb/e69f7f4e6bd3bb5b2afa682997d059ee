Durban - The Durban and Coast SPCA said they were awaiting the residential address of the owner of the anaconda so they can conduct an inspection. On Monday, IOL reported that the snake owner who confirmed that his missing pet anaconda Medusa had been found a week ago, only for reports to surface that the snake was found only yesterday, said he was not lying. Preesan Nair said he got information from the authorities that the snake had been found last week, he did not say he found the snake. Last week news broke that the anaconda that escaped from its temporary enclosure at its owner’s residence in Starwood, Phoenix, north of Durban, two weeks ago was recaptured by last Monday. After the snake was allegedly recaptured last week, the National Council of SPCA said it actioned the Durban and Coast SPCA to conduct a follow-up inspection on the condition of the anaconda. On Tuesday, Durban and Coast SPCA marketing manager Tanya Fleischer said: “Please note we are awaiting the address in order to proceed with a follow-up inspection.” IOL further said that Nair, however, confirmed to IOL on Monday afternoon, that Medusa was spotted 150m away from his Phoenix home, in an abandoned property, on Sunday. He said he picked it up, put it in a box, and took it home. However, the snake has been taken to Pietermaritzburg. “By 2pm on Monday, the snake had gone back to its previous owner. “He will either keep it or donate it to one of the parks,” said Nair. Nair said the snake was perfectly fine and was hiding when he found it. Daily News
