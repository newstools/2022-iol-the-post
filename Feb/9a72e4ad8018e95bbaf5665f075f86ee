Durban - The threat of internal disciplinary action that may lead to dismissal by eThekwini Municipality did not deter DSW workers from continuing an illegal industrial strike which has affected dozens of areas across Durban. The Mercury reported on Monday that the city had issued a warning to striking workers to return to work on Tuesday or face disciplinary action. This comes after residents complained on social media that their rubbish was not being collected. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the city met with the representatives of the striking workers and gave them an ultimatum to report for duty on Tuesday. However, Mayisela said they did not return to work. “A final ultimatum as stipulated in the Labour Relations Act has been issued for them to report for duty today, February 16, 2022,” he said. Mayisela added that those on strike would be subjected to the city’s ‘no work, no pay’ policy. The areas affected by this illegal strike include: THE MERCURY
