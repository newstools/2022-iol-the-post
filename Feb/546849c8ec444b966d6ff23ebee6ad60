DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) units have started the year positively, securing 331 arrests out of the 681 cases they received from January 1 to January 31. These were for crimes of rape, statutory rape, kidnapping, abduction, human trafficking, child abandonment, sexual exploitation, neglect, concealment of birth, attempted murder, assault with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, child neglect and indecent exposure. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said communities were commended for their efforts in identifying suspicious behaviour and for reporting their cases to the police. Timeous reporting proved to be most effective in recovering the necessary evidence required to secure the arrests and appearance of the perpetrators in courts. “These efforts have secured 29 convictions which included 10 life sentences and a total of 256 years of imprisonment for the many accused who have appeared in various courts within the KwaZulu-Natal province,” Mbele said. “Many cases are still awaiting trial in court, which will result in more suspects being charged and sentenced for their crimes.” She said crimes against women and children were of high priority at all levels within the police and reporting of any such incident should not be taken likely. Many people witness these activities and allow themselves to be trapped in abusive relationships, which will see themselves as well as their children being harmed. Mbele said the MySAPS app has created a platform where victims of crime and community members can report criminal activity to the police and remain anonymous. “Police urge all citizens to make use of this initiative, which aims to reduce the effects of these violent crimes and criminals who work tirelessly to torment their communities into living in fear under their rule.” Daily News
