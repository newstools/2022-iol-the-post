DURBAN – The eThekwini Municipality is pleading with residents to stop addressing their grievances through protests as these serve no purpose and the message is lost in the chaos. The town of Umzinto and the suburb of Malukazi, south of Durban, which have been plagued by protests, returned to normal on Tuesday.  Residents of Umzinto on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast protested over inadequate water supply in the town and surrounding areas. Malukazi, near uMlazi, had similar complaints. Residents of both places took to the streets on Monday, shutting down business operations and closing off roads.  eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Lindiwe Khuzwayo said the city was aware of the protest in Malukazi on Monday morning. “Investigations revealed that the protesters were complaining about ablution facilities in their area. City officials engaged with the protesters and the crowd soon dispersed.” Khuzwayo said they had noted the residents’ concerns and these would be addressed soon. Khuzwayo said the city was always open to engaging with residents.  “We plead with residents to stop addressing their grievances through protests as these serve no purpose and the message is lost in the chaos. We will be engaging further with the ward councillor and the community on the matter.” Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a group of 50 people blockaded the M25 at Malukazi with tyres and stones, demanding to see the ward councillor.  “It is alleged that the protests were about housing and service delivery. Gwala said police were called to monitor the situation and the crowd dispersed peacefully. No arrests or damages were reported.” Daily News
