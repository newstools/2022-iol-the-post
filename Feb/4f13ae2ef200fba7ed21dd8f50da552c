DURBAN - The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has called out to those who are single this Valentine’s Day, that they are still someone's blood type. The SANBS encouraged South Africans to share the love by donating a unit of blood. “At a time when we all miss those familiar cuddles and hugs, the longing to feel love and affection has never been greater. Present the perfect gift to a stranger by following your heart to your nearest mobile blood drive or donor centre to give one unit of liquid love which can save up to three lives,” said SANBS spokesperson Khensani Mahlangu. Did you know that at least half of all South Africans will either need blood or know someone who will need blood or a blood product transfusion at some point in their lives? “Of the 60.14 million people living in South Africa, only 432 000 – less than 1% – are regular blood donors. Our job is to change that. The SANBS is responsible for recruiting and collecting blood, plasma, and platelets at over 185 fixed donor centre sites and more than 6 000 mobile donor clinics every year. “If you are between the ages of 16 and 75, you weigh a minimum of 50kgs, you are in good health and consider your blood safe for transfusion, then you’re definitely our type,” she said. Mahlangu said since blood cannot be manufactured and has a limited shelf life, the supply must constantly be replenished. In South Africa, 3 500 blood units are needed daily to maintain a stable blood supply. “Put your heart into it and help us save lives,” Mahlangu said.
