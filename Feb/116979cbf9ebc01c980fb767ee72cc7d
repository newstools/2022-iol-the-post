DURBAN: The Department of Agriculture Land Reform and Rural Development  announced on Wednesday that the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) Programme will be reinstated.  This comes after the programme was suspended on January 13 this year to resolve the concerns raised by farmers over the costs they incurred while redeeming vouchers for agricultural inputs. Asked about what steps were taken to deal with the concerns raised by the farmers, the department said it would be able to provide further information later today. Reggie Ngcobo, department spokesperson, said that the suspension had been lifted with immediate effect.  “The department would like to encourage all affected beneficiaries to await update messages from Vodacom and messages from the department in this regard.” Ngcobo added that the department wished farmers a successful production season. “Thank you for your patience and for participating in this programme.” Dr Siyabonga Madlala, executive chairperson of the South African Farmers Development Association said that the association hoped the reinstatement of the PES programme will include and incorporate sugar cane farmers.  “If the PES programme is channelled via community associations, the onus is on these associations to ensure that each farmer benefits.” THE MERCURY
