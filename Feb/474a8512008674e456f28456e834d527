DURBAN - A man drowned in Isipingo at the weekend while he was being baptised. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was being investigated by Isipingo SAPS after a 57-year-old man drowned on Saturday while being baptised. Gwala said the circumstances surrounding the incident were being investigated. On Twitter, the SAPS said the man was being baptised in the sea near the Isipingo Beach tidal pool. Last Thursday, the eThekwini Municipality announced that beaches in eThekwini, from north to south, were closed due to the removal of shark nets by the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) ahead of severe weather and tropical cyclone Batsirai. The closure was immediate and no bathing would be allowed. The KZNSB had removed all shark nets to prevent unnecessary losses and/or damage to their equipment as a result of the strong winds and heavy seas predicted. Meanwhile, Empangeni Search and Rescue with Richards Bay officers continued their search for the 26-year-old man who drowned at Alkanstrand Beach in Richards Bay on Thursday. His body was discovered by bathers in the surf, about 500m from the scene. Daily News
