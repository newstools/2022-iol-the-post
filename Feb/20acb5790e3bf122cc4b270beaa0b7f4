Durban- At the age of four Shreya Moodley was diagnosed with profound hearing loss. But says it didn’t stop her parents, Neil and Sashnee Moodley, from creating a “new normal” for her.  “My doctors advised my parents that I would need to attend a special needs school. However, they chose to send me to mainstream schools as they knew their daughter’s potential.” Shreya said she attended Stanger Pre-Primary School and thereafter North Coast Primary from 2010 until 2016 and matriculated from Stanger Manor Secondary.  She plans to pursue a career in audiology or architecture.  “I have partial hearing in my left ear and am deaf in my right ear. “I go about my day-to-day life wearing a hearing aid in my left ear and I have a cochlear implant. “For the last two years, I have not worn my cochlear device as I developed a hematoma which causes discomfort. I also rely on lip reading but due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the wearing of masks, I have struggled at school. I had to do without lip reading and not the use of my cochlear implants. My struggles seemed to persist. Being a victim of bullying and criticism from an early age, I was even more driven to prove to myself that I was a winner in life. “Ever since I started school, my mantra has been: “I am Shreya Moodley. I am big, brave and beautiful.” “This phrase has been the epicentre of the storm of success that I have been creating for myself. “I completed matric and achieved 2 As, 3 Bs and 2 Cs. I stand out among the rest for my braveness and courageous mindset. “Audiology, being one of my choices, stems deeply from my personal experiences, physically, emotionally and psychologically. I feel that I can make a difference in the deaf community.” The Post
