DURBAN - A grey Mercedes Benz was hijacked on Randles Road in Sydenham on Tuesday by three armed suspects who approached the motorist just before he could jump into his car. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the incident occurred just before 9:30am on Tuesday. “It is alleged that today (Tuesday) at 9:25am, a motorist was driving a vehicle on Randles Road when he was robbed of his vehicle by three unknown armed males,” she said. Gwala said the suspects then fled the scene towards Waterfall Road. She said no shots were fired, and no injuries were reported. A video of the hijacking has been circulating on social media. In the video, the driver of the vehicle is seen walking to his car. Just before he opens the door, three men run towards him. The driver falls to the ground as the men try to get the car key from him. One suspect enters the driver's side, and another goes into the back passenger side on the opposite side of the car. The third suspect struggles to open the front passenger door. The car is seen reversing onto the road where the third suspect is able to jump into the vehicle, and they drive off.   Police said the Provincial Vehicle Trio Task Team, tracking company Netstar and Blue Security, conducted a joint operation to track down the vehicle. Gwala said the team followed information regarding the hijacked vehicle and successfully located it. “The vehicle was located on Shaya Road at South Mead in Mariannhill, and it was recovered,” she said. Gwala said when the suspects saw the police, they fled the scene into the bushes. Blue Security said the luxury vehicle was recovered shortly after it was hijacked due to a successful operation with specialised law enforcement, tracking companies and its highly specialised Community Crime Prevention Unit.
