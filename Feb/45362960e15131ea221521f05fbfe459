DURBAN - PLANS to employ thousands of people in the eThekwini Municipality under the presidential public employment programme are gaining momentum. In a recent meeting, city officials informed executive committee members that plans to implement the programme is on schedule. The programme is expected to come on line in March. The Public Employment Programme introduced by President Cyril Ramaphosa could create 10 000 jobs in the Metro. The eThekwini Municipality received R293 million from the national government to fund the project that will give employment opportunities for a period of about six months.

A report on the programme specifies that general workers will earn R3700 per month while the team leaders will R5100 per month. The Mercury’s sister newspaper Daily News reported that head of Economic Development and Investment Promotions Shunnon Tulsiram said opportunities were in 931 sectors and a large chunk of these would be general workers with 8 943 vacancies allocated for them, 1 418 would be for graduates, while 199 would be employed as project managers, supervisors and administrators.
