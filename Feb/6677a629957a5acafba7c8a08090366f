DURBAN - An Embo family scattered after a child spotted what turned out to be a black mamba slithering into a speaker. The Kloof and Highway SPCA said that late one night last week, Inspector Israel Silevu, received a call from a rattled citizen who was calling from his home in Embo. He told the SPCA that while the family was sitting and relaxing in the lounge, one of his children pointed out something slithering into a speaker. The family vacated their home and called Silevu. “He responded immediately and, on arrival and inspection, was completely shocked and surprised when he found a magnificent black mamba curled within the speaker,” the SPCA said. “Inspector Silevu gently and carefully removed the 2.2m black mamba who weighed just under 2kg and transported and released it into a safe location where he will live in the wild where he belongs.” The SPCA said the family made the right call. It urged residents not to harm any animal and to rather call the SPCA. Its phones were manned 24/7. Michaela Steytler agreed with the SPCA and said she loved seeing that more and more people were calling for help with snakes rather than killing them and endangering themselves. Inspector Silevu has a passion for snakes and was very experienced in handling snakes. Calls involving snakes were his favourite. Daily News
