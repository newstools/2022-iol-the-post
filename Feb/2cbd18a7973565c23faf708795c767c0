DURBAN - The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) celebrated its 71st anniversary on Monday. It is one of the oldest non-governmental organisations in the country, and one of the oldest marine science institutions in South Africa if not the African continent. Spokesperson Ann Kunz said: “As Saambr enters its 71st year, we do so with a new appreciation of our organisation, which for 71 years has stood the test of time. We have survived so much, including the Covid pandemic. We look forward to the next 71 years with excitement and the confidence that we will continue to remain true to our mission of ‘Helping people to care for the ocean.’” Kunz said as they look back over the past year during which they celebrated their 70th anniversary, several highs and lows came to mind. These included the excitement and hype of planning a huge celebration with over 500 guests. They had planned to invite many past Saambr staff members, from every corner of the globe, as well as current staff, their families, and the many friends of Saambr. But their planning came to nothing due to the pandemic. “It was a good year in many ways and although we didn’t have the planned celebrations – we celebrated the small things that we often take for granted,” Kunz said. She said staff returning to work and laughter in the corridors of Saambr was another high. “The health of our team and our animals. Our functioning Life Support Systems. Visitors in the park and the chance to connect people to our amazing animals,” Kunz said. She said the joy on a child’s face in the dolphin stadium and the curiosity of a family at the microscope bench. “All these things, which we sometimes took for granted, we now see with new eyes,” Kunz said.
