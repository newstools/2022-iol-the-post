DURBAN - An elderly woman and her adult son were tied up and attacked during a home invasion carried out by three suspects on Saturday night. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said it was alleged that at 11pm last night three unknown suspects entered the house in Montclair Road. “The suspects hit the complainant on the back of his head with an unknown object and took him to his mother’s bedroom,” she said. Gwala said both the mother and son were tied up and forced to lie down. “The suspects ransacked the house and took a TV, a laptop and cellphones before fleeing the scene,” she said. ALS Paramedics Medical Services were called to the scene just after midnight. Paramedic Garrith Jamieson said that when paramedics arrived at the house they found that two people had been tied up and assaulted. “A mother in her seventies and her son in his thirties sustained moderate injuries and were stabilised on the scene by ALS Paramedics before being transported to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment they required,” said Jamieson. Gwala said a case of house robbery was being investigated by Montclair SAPS. THE MERCURY
