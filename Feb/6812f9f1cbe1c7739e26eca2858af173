Durban: A sailor believed to be around 52-years old collapsed and died on board on Monday.  According to Paul Herbst, Medi Response responded to Durban Harbour for reports of a person who had collapsed on board a ship. He said it was a suspected heart attack.  “On arrival of paramedics, it was established that a sailor had suffered a medical emergency and passed away, seemingly some time prior to the arrival of crews. “Medi Response search and rescue crew, together with SAPS and Metro Police SAR units and NSRI station five members, moved the deceased to shore, and the matter was handed over to the South African Police Services.” SAPS have been approached for comment. A year ago, in a separate incident, five crewmen aboard a heavy lift vessel en route to Durban had to be airlifted to hospital after they were injured during an accident on board. One seaman had died.  IOL
