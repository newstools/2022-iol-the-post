DURBAN - A motorist and a passenger were found shot dead on a KwaZulu-Natal South Coast national road on Thursday evening following reports of a crash. The shooting came a day after a man was shot dead while seated in a vehicle in Margate, also in the South Coast, on Wednesday at midday. KwaZulu Private Ambulance (KZPA) said it responded to reports of a collision on the N2 between Izingolweni and Wilson’s Cutting. “When emergency services arrived they found two adult male occupants in a bakkie had sustained multiple fatal gunshot wounds,” KZPA said. “Paramedics quickly assessed the patients and found they had succumbed to their injuries before emergency services arrived.” KZPA said the circumstances around the shooting were unknown but police were investigating. Police had not commented by the time of publication. On Wednesday, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Margate police were investigating a case of murder after a 33-year-old man, while in his vehicle on a national road in Margate near a taxi rank, was shot by an unknown gunman. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body and was declared dead at the scene. Netcare 911 had responded to a shooting outside a hardware store off the R620 in Margate. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said medics assessed the scene and found that the driver, a man, had sustained fatal injuries after being shot multiple times. A passenger, a woman, sustained a minor graze to her left leg and was treated at the scene.  Daily News
