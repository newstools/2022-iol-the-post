THE Minister of Health Joe Phaahla has urged the youth to vaccinate saying if the country can get 90% of the population to be fully vaccinated the virus would mutate less. Youth between the age of 18 to 34 years old comprise the largest targeted, but the least vaccinated population in the country, with only just over 5 million out of 17.7 million target population having received this life-saving treatment.  The minister was speaking at the youth vaccination programme at Tshwane TVET College recently. “The government’s view remains that vaccination is a personal choice but at the same time, it’s a public health issue that’s why some institutions have made vaccines mandatory to protect the public. As a person, you can make the decision but when it affects other people in your space it becomes a public health issue.” Deputy minister of Higher Education and Training, Buti Manamela called on the youth to educate themselves about the coronavirus and to get information from credible sources. “The most important thing is to educate yourself about what is fake news and not. By not taking the opportunity to vaccinate, you are putting everyone at risk,” he said. Phaahla said their plea was for the youth to motivate each other to vaccinate. THE MERCURY
