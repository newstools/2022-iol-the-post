DURBAN - A 14-year-old boy drowned after getting into difficulty while swimming with friends at a dam near Bentley Drive in Copesville, Pietermaritzburg. Midlands Emergency Services (Midlands EMS) were dispatched to the scene around 2pm on Thursday. Midlands EMS spokesperson Roland Roberston said when paramedics arrived on the scene, they found that the child had been pulled out of the water by a local security service provider. Roberston said paramedics initiated a full resuscitation of the child. “Sadly, due to there being no response or signs of life, the child was declared deceased,” he said. He said reports from the scene indicated that due to the heat, a group of friends were swimming in the dam, when the deceased got into difficulty. “Unable to get to their drowning friend, the friends ran and called for help at a local clinic,” said Roberston. Midlands EMS extended heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased. Last month, The Mercury’s sister publication the Daily News reported that a 12-year-old boy narrowly escaped drowning at a low level bridge in Grimthorpe Avenue, crossing the Duzi River while swimming with his friends. KwaZulu Private Ambulance (KZPA) said the boy had been playing with his friends in the river, upstream from the bridge, and had been sucked under the bridge into water pipes. “With the help of his friends and Bishopstowe community members they managed to keep his head above water and secure while waiting for help to arrive. When SAPS Search and Rescue arrived on the scene they managed to extricate him against the strong pull of the current,” KZPA said. THE MERCURY
