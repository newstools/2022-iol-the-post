Durban - A Westville resident was sitting and watching television after work last week when a 2.6 metre black mamba slithered through the sliding door and came to a stop next to him. Local snake rescuer Nick Evans said when he received a call last Tuesday for a snake in a house, he had assumed it was just a house snake. However, when he arrived at the property and walked into the lounge, he discovered that the snake was a black mamba next to the TV behind some boards. “The man had been sitting down watching TV,  after a long day's work, when the 2.6m snake came slithering in through the sliding door, next to him. I can only imagine his reaction,” said Evans. Evans said the mamba did not lash out and try to attack the man, but rather it went about its business trying to avoid people by going towards the TV. “It was a quick and easy catch,” he said. He said the female mamba which he described as “beautiful” was released in a much safer environment away from people. THE MERCURY
