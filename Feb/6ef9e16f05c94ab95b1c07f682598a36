Powell said the details of the hijacked vehicle were unknown at this stage. He said multiple armed response officers and special operations team members were dispatched and arrived on the scene within four minutes. “It was then established that the vehicle that had been hijacked was a white Datsun Go + and that the vehicle was fitted with a Netstar tracking device,” said Powell.
