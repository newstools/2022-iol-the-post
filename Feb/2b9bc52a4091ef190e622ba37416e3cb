DURBAN - The newly appointed KZN Women in Business (KZNWIB) chairperson, Sue St Leger-Stretch said they will remain committed to continuing the legacy of connecting, supporting, and encouraging women in business. St Leger-Stretch and vice-chairperson Bianca Johnson, together with the recently voted-in committee of 10 dynamic businesswomen, were appointed on Friday. The KZNWIB was established in 1995 with an aim to support the structure for many businesswomen in a variety of business sectors through building networks, exchanging business knowledge, and ultimately assisting members to grow their businesses and in turn, make a significant contribution to the economy of the province. Over the 27 years, KZNWIB has become one of the longest-standing businesswomen’s organisations in KZN. It has grown and developed, fostered a number of entrepreneurs, and has been a successful networking forum for all of its members, from the small business owner to the corporate CEOs. On Friday, KZNWIB also welcomed NKR Outsourced HR as their meeting sponsor for the first half of the year and DKMS (formerly known as the Sunflower Fund) as their nominated charity for 2022. St Leger-Stretch said: “We welcome NKR Outsourced HR and DKMS on board and are excited to take KZN Women in Business and our members to new heights this year. It is an honour to serve this incredible organisation and its members,” she said.  Daily News
