DURBAN - Residents are unhappy with the delays in the launch of the Go!Durban bus project. Durban residents have been commenting after the mayor and city councillors made a tour of catalytic projects in eThekwini Municipality last week. The Go!Durban public transport project started a few years ago but several billions of rand later, it is yet to transport its first passenger. Last week eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda and executive committee councillors visited the project’s Pinetown route. It emerged during the visit that while the Go!Durban route between Pinetown and KwaMashu was almost ready, there were still outstanding issues such as the dispute with taxi operators over ownership of the buses. The city also needs to appoint a new contractor to complete minor construction work as the previous contractor left the site after experiencing challenges. In a letter to The Mercury, one resident said there were no other words to describe the situation but “pathetic”. “After spending over R3 billion it is sitting like a dead duck in the water for the eThekwini Municipality. “Firstly, the residents who would use the Go!Durban service and certainly the ratepayers deserve it to work,” he said. He said the negotiations with the taxi industry should have been better handled.  “Surely there are competent negotiators around who can get this all sorted out for the mutual benefit of all. Or are hidden agendas out here whilst the city is held to ransom? How sad.” Another resident, commenting on Facebook on the dispute with the taxi operators, said: “Very early in the talking stages, we knew of this conflict, but the know-it-alls in the corridors said they met with affected parties and had addressed their concerns. Oh well, when they hear concerns, they make it seem like they have been resolved.” THE MERCURY
