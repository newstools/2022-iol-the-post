DURBAN – The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) HIV Pathogenesis Programme (HPP) has launched a new HIV research clinic at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in uMlazi, Durban. UKZN said the clinic would be used to run clinical trials such as the Acute Infection Study, Elite Controller Study and Lymph Node Study, among others. It said study volunteers would be counselled and consent obtained to provide samples to advance biomedical research at UKZN. Postgraduate students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers in the university’s College of Health Sciences will use the samples to conduct research. The university added that the clinic would also offer counselling and health education, as well as free HIV tests to patients visiting the hospital, including the study volunteers. The HPP Programme has a long-standing relationship with the hospital administrators and the community. The head of the clinic, Professor Thumbi Ndung’u, expressed gratitude to the HPP staff for their resilience since the programme began in 2000. He also applauded them for their contribution to the fight against HIV. “This would not have been possible without the long-standing partnership and support from the KZN Department of Health and UKZN.” Hospital chief executive Gabriel Khawula said: “As a hospital, we will continue to support the HPP. The research conducted here assists and guides our prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies in fighting HIV.” Daily News
