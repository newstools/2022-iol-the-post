DURBAN - Registration for returning students at the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) will only open on Thursday this week. Registrations were meant to open on Monday.  Mbali Mkhize, MUT senior director of marketing and communications, said the university had decided to postpone the start of its registration process for returning students. The registration period would end on March 2. The university advised returning students not to travel to campus but to make to use of the online registration facility when registration opens. In a statement issued by the university on Saturday, the acting Registrar for MUT, Phumzile Masala, attributed the postponement to the list of National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funded students being received late on February 18 from NSFAS. “Work on the list to clear these students for registration requires three working days,” the statement said.  MUT said registration for new students were continuing, with more than 1 812 new students having been registered since February 14. The academic year has gotten off to a tumultuous start at KwaZulu-Natal tertiary institutions. Students have complained about a range of issues, including challenges with online registration and the Covid-19 vaccination policy at some institutions.  At the Durban University of Technology’s Indumiso campus in Pietermaritzburg on Monday, nine cars and a guard house were petrol bombed. This comes after a guard house and four cars were torched at DUT’s Steve Biko campus in Durban last week.  THE MERCURY
