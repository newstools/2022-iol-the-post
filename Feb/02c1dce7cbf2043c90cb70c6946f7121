DURBAN – Two men suspected of being involved in a home invasion in Verulam last week are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said it was alleged that last Friday at 3.30pm, six unknown men entered a house in Parkgate, north of Durban, and threatened the family at gunpoint. The family was robbed of jewellery, a laptop, tablet and other household items. The suspects fled in a getaway vehicle. Mbele said on Tuesday, Verulam detectives gathered information and followed possible leads. “The information led police to B Section in Parkgate where two suspects, aged 22 and 23, were arrested. A vehicle that was used in the commission of crime was also seized by police for further investigation,” Mbele said. Last week, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said a woman was forced to hand over jewellery after suspects put a gun to her head during a house robbery in Colchester Crescent in Parkgate. “Six armed suspects in a white VW Polo drove on to the property and held up the woman, her domestic employee and her neighbour who was also on their property. The robbers placed a firearm to the woman's head and threatened to shoot her if she did not hand over all the jewellery they had in their home. After handing over a large amount of jewellery, the robbers stole six cellphones and fled in their getaway vehicle,” Balram said. “The victims were not injured.” He said Rusa had received a call at 3.41pm. Their officers conducted a search for the suspects but no arrests were made. Daily News
