DURBAN – An elderly man drowned and another is suspected to have drowned on Monday afternoon in areas north of Durban. In the first incident, Netcare 911 responded to a drowning at the uMdloti tidal pool at 2.55pm. Spokesperson Shawn Herbst said reports indicated that an elderly man got into difficulty while swimming after he was pulled out to the backline. Herbst said the man was spotted by lifeguards who swam to his aid. “Lifeguards pulled the man out of the water who then rapidly started CPR after he was found unresponsive and not breathing,” Herbst said. He said when paramedics arrived on the scene, a full advanced life support resuscitation was initiated. “Despite best efforts, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated and he was sadly declared deceased on the scene,” Herbst said. At 1.30pm, Netcare 911 also responded to a drowning on the La Lucia Beach in Durban North. Herbst said reports indicated that an adult man believed to be in his sixties disappeared under the water after taking a swim at an unprotected beach. “Witnesses who saw the man leave his clothes on the beach and enter the water alerted authorities,” Herbst said. “A search was done, however, the man was not found and is presumed drowned.” Police had not commented by the time of publication.
