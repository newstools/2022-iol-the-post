DURBAN - Twenty head of cattle were struck by lightning and killed over the weekend in Kokstad, northern KwaZulu-Natal. KZN Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi said she would be visiting the area on Tuesday where the cattle were killed and the assessment would include coming up with preventive measures to mitigate the effects of such disasters in the future. Sithole-Moloi expressed deep concern about the impact of climate change on the communities. This follows recent floods that engulfed the Midlands, leaving many communities destitute and affecting farm production. “I would like to urge residents to exercise extreme caution and to follow weather reports so that they can stay updated on the conditions in the area,” Sithole-Moloi said. DARD said more than eight communities were affected, as well as the department’s research station. The department added that the visit will include the monitoring of affected farmers and those who were left destitute by the ordeal. Daily News
