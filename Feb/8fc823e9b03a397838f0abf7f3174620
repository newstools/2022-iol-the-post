DURBAN – Three men are expected to appear at the Durban Magistrate's Court this week following their apprehension by a team from Durban North SAPS last night. The three were nabbed while police were conducting crime-prevention operations in the uMhlanga area. The officers noticed a vehicle parked at a parking lot with three men inside. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the suspects tried to flee the scene. “As the team approached this vehicle, they tried to flee and (their vehicle) collided with the police vehicle and another vehicle that was parked. The police officers were able to prevent the suspects from fleeing,” said Mbele. She added that upon conducting a search of the vehicle, the team recovered two pistols with their serial numbers filed off, and that the vehicle had false registration plates.  The three men, aged between 21 and 33, were placed under arrest and taken to the Durban North police station for further processing. The suspects face various charges. “The suspects will appear at the Durban Magistrate’s Court, facing charges of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition as well as possession of a vehicle suspected to be stolen,” said Mbele.
