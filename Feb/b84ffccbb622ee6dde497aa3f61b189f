DURBAN - An inquest docket has been opened at Greenwood Park SAPS for further investigation after a 22-year-old man was found dead in his cell on Wednesday. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the body of the suspect, who has not been named, was discovered on Wednesday at 1:30.pm. Mbele said police were conducting their duties at the prisoner cells, when they noticed that one of the cells appeared to be empty and they went inside to inspect it. “Upon inspection the police officer found the body of a 22-year-old suspect hanging from the window in the cell,” she said. Mbele said the suspect had been arrested for theft. “The motive surrounding the incident is unknown,” she said. Last year, IOL reported that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had investigated a case of death in police custody after a suspect was found hanged in a holding cell in Durban. Police said the highly intoxicated 25-year-old man was incoherent and claimed that his family were trying to kill him. He was not wearing a mask. Ipid said the man, who has not been named, became very rude and wanted to fight with the officers. They managed to get him into a temporary cell to process him for refusing to wear a mask and for causing a disturbance inside the police station. However, when officers went back to check on the man, he was found hanging by his belt. THE MERCURY
