DURBAN - A 47-year-old security guard was shot dead while responding to a robbery at a shop in Old Main Road in Doonside, eManzimtoti, on Saturday. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said it was alleged that on February 5 at 8.30pm three men entered a shop and posed as customers. Gwala said they suddenly drew firearms and demanded cash. She said a panic button was pressed and security officers responded. The suspects opened fire on the security officers. “A 47-year-old man sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and was declared dead at the scene,” said Gwala. Emer-G-Med Paramedics spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said paramedics responded to a shooting incident. He said reports from the scene indicated that a man suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was found in a state of cardiac arrest. “Despite extensive resuscitation efforts by emergency care practitioners, the man succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead at the scene,” said Van Reenen. Police said the deceased’s firearm was also taken by the suspects. Charges of robbery and murder are being investigated by the eManzimtoti SAPS. Meanwhile, just after 7am on Saturday morning, paramedics responded to the scene of a shooting incident on the M7 near the N2 bridge. Van Reenen said the victim of the shooting was believed to be approximately 40 years of age. “A male… was seated in his tow truck when an unknown number of suspects sprayed his vehicle with a high-calibre firearm in a drive-by shooting,” he said. The man sustained gunshot wounds to his abdomen and lower limbs, and was rushed privately to a nearby hospital for further care. THE MERCURY
