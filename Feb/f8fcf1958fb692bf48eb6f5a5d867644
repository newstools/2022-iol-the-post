DURBAN - THE National Freedom Party (NFP) says it welcomes the recommendation made by the Judicial Service and Commission (JSC) for Judge Mandisa Maya to be the country’s next Chief Justice.  The party said she had a vision to bring about much-needed change within the judiciary in general and in the courts systems and processes. JSC spokesperson Dali Mpofu said on Saturday night that the JSC had resolved to recommend Judge Maya, who is the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), for the position.  In a statement released by the NFP, the party said Judge Maya is the most suitable candidate. “We welcome her recommendation not because she is black and a female, but simply because she is capable and ethical. Her capabilities go beyond her skin colour. Judge Maya represents a democratic society which we all dream of, a society where we are all equal before the law,” said the statement. The party said Judge Maya’s background and CV would leave President Cyril Ramaphosa no choice but to concur with the JSC recommendation. The party further warned Judge Maya to be aware of those who will do anything to undermine her. “We wish to warn her against men who will do anything and everything to undermine her. We are well aware that there would be some within the judiciary who will make her tasks and responsibilities difficult but we want to assure Judge Maya that South Africans would be watching,” said the statement.
