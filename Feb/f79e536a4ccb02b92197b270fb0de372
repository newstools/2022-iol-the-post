Durban - THE National Freedom Party (NFP) has reiterated a call for security for  councillors saying it has become aware of a threat to one of its councillors in Nongoma. The party said, in a statement, that  its councillors who were being threatened should be provided with guards, failing which the NFP will take the matter to court. The party said it had become aware of social media discussions around a “by-election” in the Nongoma area. The only way a by-election can take place is if the ward councillor resigns or dies. The NFP’s Canaan Mdletshe made a ’clarion call’ for the councillor in the affected ward to be protected. Mdletshe said individuals on social media had been discussing plans for a by-election in ward 7 in Nongoma, which the party viewed as a direct threat to their ward councillor there. “We have reported the matter to the political killing task team and they have promised to follow it up. “We cannot fold our hands while individuals are publicly declaring and waging war on our councillors, this is a serious matter and a serious threat to our democracy,” he said. He said councillors had been elected by the public to serve and threats made against them should not be tolerated. “Going forward, we have instructed all councillors in their respective municipalities to bring the threats to the attention of the Speaker of the municipality. We want them to be (provided) security guards. “If this does not materialise, we will be forced to take the matter to court because it is clear that there are individuals or groupings that are hellbent on ensuring that our councillors are assassinated.” The KwaZulu-Natal police have been approached for comment regarding the matter.
