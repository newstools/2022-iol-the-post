Durban – Max’s Lifestyle Village, owned by Max Mqadi, issued a warning on Monday against an agency which claimed to be booking up-and-coming DJs and other artists to perform at the popular uMlazi restaurant. Max’s Lifestyle Village distanced itself from the scam which uses social media to contact people. “It has come to our attention that some people are trying to set up an agency  by going out to the public on social media and messaging platforms, and claiming to help upcoming DJs and other talents get booked and perform at our establishment while also defrauding customers with fictitious investment schemes,” said a statement issued by management on the establishment’s social media platform. Max’s Lifestyle Village advised the public that any acts and DJs were booked directly by the establishment and not through outside parties.  It also warned people not to fall victim to the fake investment schemes. “As Max’s Lifestyle Village, we hereby inform our customers, supporters and the general public that we are not affiliated with this fraudulent scheme, and we strongly advise the public to avoid investing in or dealing with such schemes.”  The establishment appealed to the public to notify the Max’s Lifestyle office about any suspicious activity. The office can be contacted on the customer service number: 031 906 1393 “At all times we are devoted to providing you with high quality and secure services,” said management. THE MERCURY
