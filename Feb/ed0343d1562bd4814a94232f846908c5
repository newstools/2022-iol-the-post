DURBAN - THE Department of Transport has condemned illegal street racing after a crash on Umgeni Road in Springfield Park on Sunday. It is alleged that the crash was due to street racing.  Emer-G-Med spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said its paramedics and Netcare 911 paramedics responded to an incident at the intersection of Umgeni Road and Intersite Avenue in the early hours of Sunday morning after they received a call about a serious collision. “On arrival at the scene two vehicles were found to have collided at high speed and high impact, with one of the vehicles leaving the roadway and ploughing into a crowd of people,” said Van Reenen. Two people were injured; one of whom was critically injured, he said.  “The injured were treated and stabilised on the scene before being taken to a nearby hospital for further care. “It is alleged that the incident is related to illegal street racing activities in the area, however, this is speculative and will form the subject of a SAPS investigation,” said Van Reenen.    KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane said they condemn such activities because they often result in fatal accidents.  The department was working together with eThekwini Metro police to monitor the roads, he said. “We are aware that the people who do this, change the location once they notice that police are there. However, we are going to continue to monitor the roads especially the ones where street racing usually happens,” said Ncalane. He urged motorists to be responsible on the roads and to refrain from street racing.   THE MERCURY
