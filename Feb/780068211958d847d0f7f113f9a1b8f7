Durban: ANC ward councillor Themba Mnguni and his co-accused Nomthandazo Mbeje have been released on R5 000 bail.  The pair are charged with the murder of Beatrice Nzama, 60, Ncamisile Shange, 34 and Philisiwe Jili, 37, who were killed in a drive-by shooting in Inanda in September.  Four others have been arrested, charged and released on bail for the same matter.  According to Natasha Kara, spokesperson for the NPA in KwaZulu-Natal, Mnguni and Mbeje made their second appearance in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Friday for their bail application. She said in addition to the murder charges, the pair also face five counts of attempted murder and a charge of conspiracy to commit public violence, relating to an incident that took place at a political gathering in September 2021, before the local government elections. “Their bail conditions are that they must not interfere with witnesses, report bi-weekly to a police station, and hand in their passports.” The matter was adjourned to February 22.
