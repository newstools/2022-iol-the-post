Which would you choose – losing a year of education or losing your child forever? The teachers' lives are also at risk" https://t.co/oTG8fUAoxz pic.twitter.com/jO0r9YgtBT The girls died when KZN was in the grip of the third wave of Covid-19 infections. POST reported that the girls’ parents, Sagel Balsarang and Karishma Pillay, believed KZN schools should remain close until infections were reduced. At the time of their passing, KZN’s premier, Sihle Zikalala, said an increase in cluster cases had been noted, with schools emerging as the biggest contributor to the surge in the disease.  More than 120 schools had reported cluster infections, and more than 800 pupils and teachers had been affected.  Pupils had made up at least 95% of the number, while teachers accounted for the remaining 5%. Daily News
