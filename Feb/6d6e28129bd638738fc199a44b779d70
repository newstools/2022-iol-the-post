DURBAN - The eThekwini Municipality has appealed to residents affected by the illegal DSW industrial strike to keep rubbish in their yards as the city consults its legal team after workers failed to heed two warnings to return to work. This comes after the municipality issued two ultimatums warning workers who have embarked on the illegal strike to return to work on Tuesday and again on Wednesday or face disciplinary action that could lead to dismissal. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the municipality said the Cleansing and Solid Waste Unit (DSW) has been unable to service some parts of the city due to the ongoing illegal strike. “The municipality is working tirelessly to bring the situation to normalcy and is also consulting its legal team on the next course of action after an ultimatum to return to work by today(Wednesday), has been disregarded by some employees. “We urge residents to keep their refuse bags in their properties until notice is communicated. The Municipality regrets any inconvenience caused,” said the city. Commenting on the announcement on Facebook, some residents called for the workers who failed to return to work to be fired and replaced with those who are unemployed and struggling to find work. A resident said: “So many unemployed people are looking for work, me included. You have people who earn a good salary there, yet they want to strike. Fire the lot and employ people that want to work.” One woman said she would not be able to bring her rubbish bags into her yard because of the maggots. Another resident complained that “the rubbish is stinking on the roadside, because of the heat. There's maggots on the bags.” One resident questioned why only some areas were affected: “Wonder if we still have to pay for our levies and rates this month. Strange, it's also not everywhere and only in certain areas.” Areas affected under North Central Region are as follows:  THE MERCURY
