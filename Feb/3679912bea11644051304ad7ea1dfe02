DURBAN – The French Red Cross Agency has appealed for help after Madagascar was hit again by a cyclone, tropical cyclone Emnati. On Friday, the French Red Cross Agency said stocks of emergency materials provided by the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (IFRC), IFRC Africa and Malagasy Red Cross were intact, and distributions will begin shortly. The Malagasy Red Cross Agency in the urban commune of Mananjary, Madagascar President Ramahandry Lizzie said: “Cyclone Emnati has increased the number of people in temporary shelter sites. It’s important to ensure that these places stay clean to prevent the outbreak of diseases.” More than 44 000 people were evacuated from Madagascar due to tropical cyclone Emnati, the second cyclone to hit the island in two weeks after tropical cyclone Batsirai. By Wednesday, the IFRC and the Malagasy Red Cross Agency were already in Madagascar to provide additional aid to communities suffering from weeks of devastating weather. According to the IFRC, 37 386 people in seven regions were evacuated as a precautionary measure, and placed within 130 shelter sites. The IFRC said in the Vohipeno District in the Fitovinany region, a few hours after tropical cyclone Emnati hit the area, 1 721 people were rescued. “Cyclone Emnati has caused flooding and landslides in the southern part of Madagascar,” the IFRC said. “As of Feb 23, the number of people who have been evacuated pre-emptively was 44 297,” it reported.
