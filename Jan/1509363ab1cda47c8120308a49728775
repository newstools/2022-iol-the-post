Durban - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate(IPID) are investigating an incident where a police officer shot a mentally challenged patient in the hand during a call out to a sibling altercation in Inanda. IPID spokesperson Grace Langa said Inanda police were attending to a complaint involving a mentally challenged patient who was trying to stab his sister. Langa said when police arrived the patient allegedly rushed towards a police member who fell to the ground. “As the patient tried to stab him, another member shot him on his hand,” she said IPID said the patient was rushed to KwaMashu Clinic in a stable condition. In November last year, IOL reported that IPID was investigating the death of a mentally-challenged patient on the North Coast as a result of police action. According to Langa, it was alleged a mentally-challenged patient went into a Boxer store in Jozini and armed himself with bush knives. “It is further alleged, he then went outside in the road, damaging about four vehicles  and injuring two people. “Police officials intervened by trying to calm the man down, but despite these efforts, he charged at the police officials. “Police members fired shots, injuring him. He was taken to the clinic where he later passed away,” said Langa. THE MERCURY
