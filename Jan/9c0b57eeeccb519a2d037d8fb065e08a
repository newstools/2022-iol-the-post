DURBAN – A man who was assaulted with a brick in the driveway of his home at the start of December 2021 has died of his injuries. The man, believed to be Hennie du Plessis, was airlifted to hospital on December 9, 2021, after he was assaulted on his driveway that morning. On Saturday, Underberg Emergency Medical Services (UEMS) manager Kate Bodmann said: “It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the passing of a patient that UEMS treated and transported to hospital after a vicious attack on December 9, 2021. “Unfortunately his injuries were just too severe.” Bodmann said UEMS would like to send their most sincere condolences to his wife, daughter and son, as well as all his friends and colleagues. During the incident, Bodmann reported that UEMS paramedics were called out for a person who had been assaulted on the driveway at his home at 7.30am. “On arrival, paramedics found a 52-year-old man that had sustained serious trauma to his head and face. UEMS paramedics worked to stabilise the gentleman before (transporting him) to Pietermaritzburg. En route, the patient deteriorated and a decision was made to activate Netcare 911’s helicopter due to the patient’s condition,” Bodmann said. The helicopter landed at the top of Lundies Hill on the R617 where the patient was handed over. “Reports from the scene suggest the patient was leaving for work when he was attacked with a brick by an unknown number of assailants,” Bodmann said.
