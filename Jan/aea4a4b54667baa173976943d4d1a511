DURBAN - The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) announced today that the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) vouchers for subsistence farmer beneficiaries had been suspended with immediate effect. In a statement today, the department said it is reviewing, re-engineering and redesigning the PES implementation, to address the challenges experienced. “The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) wishes to inform subsistence farmers who are beneficiaries of the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) vouchers of the decision to suspend all PES implementation with immediate effect until further notice,” said the department. The department said it had received endless complaints from the PES beneficiaries and the South African community at large regarding various challenges regarding the PES implementation. “These implementation challenges cannot be left unattended, hence, the decision by the department to temporarily halt the current implementation,” it said. Beneficiaries are further urged to check their cellphone messages, which are sent by the department, it said. The department added that it had issued production input vouchers in support of subsistence producers as part of the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) in South Africa. Last year, it was reported by Independent Media’s Political Bureau that phase 2 of the Presidential Employment Stimulus kicked off in October, with a total of R11 billion set aside by the National Treasury for the programme. The Presidential Employment Stimulus was first announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa in October 2020 as part of the government’s response to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. THE MERCURY
