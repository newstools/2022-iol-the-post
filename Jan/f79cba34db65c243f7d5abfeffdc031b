DURBAN – The Ugu District Municipality issued an urgent notice to residents on more water woes on Saturday night. The municipality said highly turbid waters down from the Berg were disrupting Boboyi Plant Production. The uMzimkulu River was currently on high flow with extremely turbid waters from the rainy Berg, which was causing a reduced flow of water into the plant from the dam. “The above means the plant production has been reduced by more than 10% so far,” the municipality said. “In the quest to avoid the collapse of the system, water rationing will be applied with immediate effect.” The municipality has implemented a water rationing plan with immediate effect. This is the municipality’s water rationing plan: “This plan is expected to  achieve the balance of the system and reduce the demand,” the municipality said. “As from Monday all systems will get water and rationing will be done on inlets without affecting any area.” The municipality also urged residents to use water sparingly.
