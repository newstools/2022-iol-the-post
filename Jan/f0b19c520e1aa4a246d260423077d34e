DURBAN - THE EThekwini Municipality said teams are working to repair cables to resolve power outage issues in Glenwood, parts of  Umbilo, Sydenham, Sherwood and Westridge. Speaking to The Mercury today, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said Glenwood, parts of Umbilo, Sydenham, Sherwood, and parts of Westridge experienced power outages due to cable faults and faults on the network. “There are teams assigned to do cable repairs for all affected areas,” he said. The city apologised to affected residents for the inconvenience. “We apologise for the inconvenience, and we continue to encourage customers to report faults timeously as teams are always on standby to assist,” said Mayisela. A resident posted on Facebook this morning: The power came back on in upper Glenwood just after 6am, but has gone off again just after 8am.” Glenwood councillor Sakhile Mngadi, in an update to residents this morning, said he had been in contact with the depot responsible for dispatching the team working on getting the power back. “As I stated, the 3 phase trip at the Glenwood Major 1830 substation has caused a widespread blackout. I will remain in touch with them to ensure they speed things up,” he said. In an update at midday, Mngadi said there was a new fault due to overloading of the lines that began at 8am. He suspected that fridges and geysers that were all off most of yesterday may have overloaded the circuits. “The new fault has now been located which also affects parts of Sherwood,” he said. Mngadi said the expected time for power to return is 7pm tonight.  “I am going there to try ensure this is done sooner as that will mean some areas were without power for 36 hours,” he said.
