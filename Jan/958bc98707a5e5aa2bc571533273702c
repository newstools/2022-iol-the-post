DURBAN - BRINGING some hope and cheer to Wentworth, three friends are hosting free outdoor screenings of movies for residents, especially the youth. Darrian Smith, Wayne Jean-Pierre and Alan Moolman came up with the idea as they wanted to create a safe place for children and families to come out and spend time together. The latest screening was on Saturday. Wentworth is a crime hot spot especially for gang-related drug wars that lead to shootings where residents are often caught in the crossfire. Last year it was reported that additional police resources had been deployed to deal with the gang and drug-related crimes that plague the area. Smith said that getting youth and families together to watch the movie screenings was a way of taking back the community. “We are hoping that this safe space would let families forget about the scary stuff taking place in Wentworth and the movies would be able to bring a message of hope and inspiration in these troubled times. For these two or three hours children forget all about the social ills and are not involved in fighting or being tempted to be involved in drugs.” Smith added that he, Jean-Pierre and Moolman just wanted to give back to their community. Lawrence Palmer, a local community leader, said that the movie screenings were welcomed by disadvantaged communities. “Even if it’s for one child who can say it’s a day I will never forget, it’s worth it.” Thirteen-year-olds Levy Dugen and Jody Williams both enjoyed Saturday’s movie and said they were looking forward to more screenings. Smith added that there were plans to expand outdoor screenings of movies to other areas including Lamontville, Phoenix and Newlands East.   THE MERCURY
