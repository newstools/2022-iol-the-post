DURBAN - An adult and child have been transported to hospital by ambulance after they survived a near-drowning along the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. The KwaZulu Private Ambulance (KZPA) service said it responded to the Glenmore Beach area following reports of a near-drowning on Tuesday afternoon. The KZPA said when emergency services arrived, they found that two patients were being treated by the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Edward. “According to witnesses, a 14-year-old child and adult got caught in a current, life savers rushed to their assistance and managed to pull the patients to safety,” the KZPA said. “Paramedics continued treating the patients for near-drowning and transported the child to hospital for further care.” Over the weekend, an eight-year-old child drowned at a resort in Port Edward. The KZPA also responded to that drowning incident at a resort. When paramedics arrived, they found the NSRI Port Edward had started cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the child who had drowned in a pool. “Advanced Life Support paramedics took over resuscitation and were able to get the child’s heart beating again,” KZPA said. The service said the patient was then rushed to a local hospital with advanced life support intervention. “Despite all the efforts of paramedics and hospital staff, the child deteriorated and was pronounced dead at the hospital,” the KZPA said.
