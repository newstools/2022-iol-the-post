Hlengwa said Hlabisa criss-crossed the country to carry the IFP’s promise of good governance, integrity, and accountability to our communities during the party’s election campaign.  “He is a true servant leader, committed to making the best decisions for our people.  “He spoke, and the people listened, entrusting the IFP with many municipalities.” “Happy Birthday Bulawayo, and may you have many more!  “May you continue to serve the people of South Africa in the spirit of ubuntu/botho,” Hlengwa said.
