DURBAN - Police are looking for the driver who drifted a vehicle along the shoreline of a Richards Bay beach over New Year’s weekend. Only the top half of a Rover could be seen sticking out of the water off a Richards Bay beach after the driver showboated in front of beachgoers. Two videos of the incident, which apparently took place on New Year’s Day, have gone viral on social media - one of the driver showboating and the other of the semi-submerged vehicle. There are also other videos and images of the semi-submerged vehicle and recovery by tow trucks. Strange day at Richards Bay today!!
