DURBAN - Tugela Mouth Beach remains closed while the Mandeni Local Municipality has cleaned up the area. The municipality had closed the beach due to the flooding of Tugela Mouth and other associated facilities within the precinct. On Sunday, municipal manager Sizwe Khuzwayo said the beach was still closed as clean-up operations were still under way. Last week Khuzwayo had issued a notice advising beachgoers not to swim or go into Tugela Mouth Beach. “The Municipality’s Amenities Section has decided to close the beach due to the flooding of Tugela Mouth and other associated facilities within the precinct,” Khuzwayo said. “The activities will include picnicking, religious activities, fishing, swimming, launching of boats and any other activities that will need the use of the beach and the municipal amenities.” Last Sunday, the municipality had posted on its Facebook page that Tugela Mouth Beach had been temporarily closed due to debris being cast out by the sea within the area designated for swimming. Meanwhile, the KwaDukuza Municipality informed residents and stakeholders that Thompson Bay Beach was safe for public use and bathing following the precautionary closure last Monday. Spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said: “Water test results received by the municipality confirm the quality to be good, hence the local authority’s decision to reopen the facility.” Daily News
