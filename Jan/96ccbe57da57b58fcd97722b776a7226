NINE drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol during numerous joint operations rolled out by Mandeni Local Municipality on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal during the festive period. In a statement today, the municipality said the operations were carried out in partnership with various public safety sectors during the course of the festive season some of which included the blitz patrols in residential areas and roadblocks. The rollout kicked off on December 17 with a joint operation with SAPS at the SAPPI access road near Mandeni Plaza. There were joint operations at the P451 towards Tugela Mouth Beach, and other operations en route to the CBD and Dokodweni Beach respectively, said the municipality. “A total of nine arrests were made for persons driving under the influence of alcohol, one driver has since been formally charged for driving under influence and attempting to bribe officers,” it said. The municipality added that there were also two reportedly missing persons. “One at Matigulu River and one at Dokodweni Beach, although the search has been intensified, unfortunately they have not been found,” it said. Mayor Thabani Mdlalose lauded the dedication of both SAPS and Mandeni traffic officers for working tirelessly to ensure the safety of all road users and beach goers. “Our security cluster left no stone unturned in trying to provide holiday makers with a safe festive season with assistance from SAPS and other security agencies. We are very proud of the manner in which they conducted themselves,” he said. THE MERCURY
