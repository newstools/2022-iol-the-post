DURBAN - A woman believed to be in her 40s died in a multi-vehicle accident on the M7 at the N2 interchange this afternoon. The accident involved two trucks and three cars. ALS Paramedics Medical Services said paramedics responded after receiving several calls about a collision just after 1pm. Paramedic Garrith Jamieson said: “It is believed that a truck had somehow lost control before colliding with another truck and three motor vehicles,” he said. Jamieson said the collision happened at the robot junction and the truck managed to stop a few metres down the road from the collision point of impact. “One person, a lady in her forties, sustained critical injuries and paramedics attempted to resuscitate her however her injuries were too severe and she passed away on the scene,” he said. Jamieson said another woman, who has not been named, sustained minor injuries. He said the woman was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment that she required.
