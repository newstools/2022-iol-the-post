DURBAN - The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) says that it has not approved, sanctioned or authorised ‘matric upgrade centres’ or ‘UKZN Foundation Programme’ opportunities. Normah Zondo, UKZN executive director of corporate relations, said Grade 12 pupils, their parents and guardians are warned against applying to or registering at any matric upgrade centre claiming to be associated with UKZN. “The university has not approved or sanctioned the use – which is illegal – of its name, logo, branding, campuses, lecture venues and or residences by these businesses,” she said. Zondo said there is no relationship between these centres and the university. “Their operation on UKZN campuses is illegal and not permitted. They are falsely creating the impression that they are in a partnership with the university,” she said. Zondo said UKZN is aware that many previous applicants to illegal “matric upgrade centres” were left in an unfavourable position after losing their money to these businesses. “The university will institute legal action against any matric upgrade centre found to be unlawfully representing itself as being associated with the university, and where such centre conducts business on and/or uses any of the UKZN facilities for such purposes,” she said. The university said pupils uncertain about upgrading their matric and who require further information and guidance, should contact the Department of Basic Education at www.education.gov.za, the KZN Department of Education at www.kzneducation.gov.za, or the high school where they were registered and wrote their 2021 NSC exam, for help.
