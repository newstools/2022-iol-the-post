DURBAN - Police arrested four suspects on charges of business robbery, attempted murder and the possession of explosives. Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the suspects, aged between 25 and 37, were arrested on Sunday. Gwala said it was alleged that at 11pm on Sunday, police responded to a report of a burglary in progress at a shopping centre on St Johns Avenue in Pinetown. When police arrived, they spotted a group of men attempting to flee the premises and they opened fire at police. “Four of the suspects were apprehended and were found in possession of cellphones, drills, gloves, a crowbar and explosives,” Gwala said. He said that while police were busy at the scene, they saw a white vehicle driving in the vicinity. When police officers approached the vehicle, the suspects sped off. “Police gave chase and the suspects abandoned the vehicle on Wilson Drive in Caversham Glen,” Gwala said. “Upon searching the vehicle, police found various pieces of police uniforms, a bullet proof vest and a firearm with 16 rounds of ammunition.” Gwala said the security guard who was at the shopping centre arrived and told police that he was on duty when the same vehicle with five occupants in police uniform arrived at the scene. The security guard was forced into the vehicle and the panic button was taken away from him. He was dropped off in the bushes in New Germany. The suspects gained entry into the receiving area and they stole two cellphones from one of the shops. She said the suspects were expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court today.
