DURBAN - The SAPS Umbilo Task Team arrested four suspects for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and possession of a dangerous weapon. Umbilo Community Policing Forum chairperson Heather Roos said that at 11.30am on Wednesday, the Umbilo Task Team was conducting an operation around Queensmead Mall in the Umbilo area when they noticed a silver Datsun Go with four men inside. Roos said the officers observed the vehicle very suspiciously driving around Queensmead Mall. They decided to do a stop and search on the occupants and the vehicle. “When the members attempted to stop the vehicle the suspects fled and a high speed chase ensued. The vehicle was stopped in Umbilo Road,” Roos said. The occupants were found with one 9mm pistol with the serial number filed off, one 9mm live round, one magazine and one knife, she said. Police also found a cellphone which the suspects could not account for. All four suspects were detained at Umbilo SAPS. “One of the suspects was linked to four cases of Trio Crimes,” Roos said. She said the suspects were arrested for the possession of an unlicensed firearm, the possession of unlicensed ammunition, the possession of a dangerous weapon and section 36 possession – any goods for which there is reasonable suspicion that they have been stolen and there is no satisfactory account to explain such possession. Roos added that the suspects would be profiled to establish if they could be linked to more cases. Police acknowledged receipt of the media query but had not commented by the time of publication.
