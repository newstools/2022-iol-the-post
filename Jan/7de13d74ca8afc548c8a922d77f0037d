During the festive season motorists may be confronted with roadside incidents or emergencies more often and may not know what to do. Marshall Security has offered motorist advice on what to do if you witness an accident or emergency: Marshall Security said your first responder is going to need your help in order to help.  This is what they’d like you to provide: “A good course of action if you are on a community safety/security group, is to send a pin drop of the current location where the emergency occurred,” said the security company. Here’s a quick play-by-play on that process: “If you don’t feel safe, are unable to assist for whatever reason, or there are other people already there helping, you can sit this one out,” said Marshall Security. However, the security company said its members, or other law enforcement and emergency support providers, may want to talk to you about what you saw. “Yes, you may need to make a statement of some sort, especially if you were the first person there,” said the company. In addition, the company advised that only qualified people should be providing medical support. “Please don’t provide medical support unless you are qualified to do so, or unless absolutely necessary. It’s generally best to wait for the medical team, who are already on their way,” said Marshall Security.  What to do if you are involved in a roadside incident or emergency:  THE MERCURY
