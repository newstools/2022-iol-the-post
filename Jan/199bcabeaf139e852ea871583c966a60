DURBAN - A homeowner ran barefoot on hot tar to help apprehend a house robber in Westville, west of Durban, last week. Mobi-Claw 911 spokesperson Mike Myers said last Thursday at 3.49pm they received a panic activation from a client who reported that civilians were chasing a suspect past his business premises and required help. Volunteers in the area and MC911 management were first on the scene. “The homeowner and his friend had managed to detain the suspect who was caught in possession of the stolen laptop.” “At the time of the detention, a scuffle ensued and the suspect picked up an empty liquor bottle in an attempt to assault the person detaining him, only for the suspect to realise that the bottle was plastic,” Myers said. He said MC911 management cuffed and secured the suspect who was then handed over to Westville SAPS on their arrival. The suspect has been charged. “Well done to the homeowner and his friend for their bravery in this arrest,” Myers said. “The homeowner was barefoot during the chase on a very hot tar surface and sustained massive blistering on his feet. MC911 ops director and medic Wynand Laatz treated the injuries on scene.” “Once again, it shows just how much teamwork plays in such positive results. Well done and thank you to our client for using our service to help others in need, and thank you to all those volunteers and SAPS members that responded and assisted.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of burglary and theft was being investigated by Westville SAPS. She said the complainant alleged that he heard a noise while he was at his house in Westville. When he went to investigate he noticed an unknown man running away with a laptop and a bag. “He managed to chase and caught the suspect along the pedestrian bridge. A 33-year-old suspect was placed under arrest,” Gwala said. She said the suspect was expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Daily News
