Durban Tourism has extended the deadline for the first annual Durban Tourism Awards entries to ensure that all local tourism product owners have sufficient time to enter. The awards seek to raise awareness of the value and importance of tourism in terms of local, provincial, and national economic growth, and offer the public a voice through feedback and reviews. The deadline for entries of nominees which were supposed to close on February 10, has now been extended to the 25th. According to Durban Tourism, the awards scheduled to take place in May, aim to reward products that attract tourists to the city while contributing to job creation and economic growth,  through products that will inspire visitors’ trust by demonstrating the city’s high standards and commitment to excellence. The award categories include service excellence, tour operators, emerging entrepreneurs, meetings and exhibitions, sustainable development, tour guides, upcoming filmmakers, and a special Mayor’s award. Each category will receive five nominations of four runners-up and one winner. The winner will walk away with a cash prize, a laptop, iPad, or tablet, six months of website development and maintenance, and complimentary data for six months. Durban Tourism said that the awards will serve as a platform to empower small, medium, and micro enterprises, particularly those in townships and rural areas. The enterprises will also be empowered with new skills to ensure compliance and sustainability and to assist them to seamlessly transition into the mainstream tourism sector.
