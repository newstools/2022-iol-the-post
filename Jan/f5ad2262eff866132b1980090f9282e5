Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said its officers also responded to the scene after 10am. Balram said reaction officers were dispatched to the scene after residents reported hearing rapid gunfire in the vicinity. “On arrival, it was established that the driver of a white Toyota Corolla Cross had been shot while seated in his vehicle,” he said, adding that several rifle cartridges were recovered at the scene. The man was assessed by paramedics and declared deceased at the scene, Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said. “Reports from the scene indicated that an adult male believed to be in his forties had sustained multiple high calibre gunshot wounds throughout his body,” said Herbst.
