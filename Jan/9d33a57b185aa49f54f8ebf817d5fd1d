DURBAN - The SPCA is raising funds to assist with a sterilisation clinic in Ezinketheni, Pietermaritzburg, within the next few months. Ezinketheni, on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg, is where SPCA staff and volunteers of their clinic team travelled to recently. With the assistance from Mama Ntombi's Community Projects, the SPCA were able to host a free rabies clinic. The SPCA reported that 79 pets were vaccinated against rabies, dewormed and treated against ticks and fleas as well as for mange. The SPCA reported that pet owners were educated about good nutrition for their pets, the importance of sterilisation and various diseases that affect their pet companions. “Due to financial constraints, our team was unable to bring back any animals for sterilisation. We will however be returning to start a dipping programme for this community which will help treat the dogs suffering with mange and also help keep the ticks at bay,” it said. Ezinketheni, along with many other communities in Pietermaritzburg, are in dire need of assistance. The SPCA said it was going to work hard to assist these communities with rabies and educational clinics. The SPCA is asking for donations, and says no amount is too small. Pietermaritzburg SPCA Standard Bank Account Number: 250068052 Branch Code: 057525 Reference: EZINSTERI (Please use correct reference in order for us to allocate accordingly) The SPCA in Durban is also in need of dry adult dog food because stock is running low. The SPCA reported that in December more than 1 600 animals came through their doors, which depleted their food stock.  Please assist by dropping off dog food, making a donation online at www.spcadbn.org.za/donate.php or sending a delivery via Takealot. Daily News
