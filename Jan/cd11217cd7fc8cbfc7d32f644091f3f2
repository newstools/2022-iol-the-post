DURBAN - eThekwini Municipality ward 60 councillor Fakazi Mdletshe has warned residents not to be duped into buying land from people posing as property agents. Ward 60 covers Verulam, north of Durban. Mdletshe said there had been a few incidents where residents bought land from “property agents” only to find out that the same piece of land has been sold multiple times to several people. Mdletshe also said the public can visit municipal offices at Sizakala Centres to verify property or land ownership. “People have lost their life savings because of this scam,” Mdletshe said. Meanwhile, the city issued a stern warning to those invading land. To report land invasion, contact eThekwini Municipality’s security management unit on 031 311 4699, 031 311 4701 and 031 311 4702. Commenting on a Facebook post by the eThekwini Municipality on the matter, Pete Graham said he had been reporting the Malacca Road land invasion for years. Not only has the city done nothing about it the electricity department electrified the top camp in direct contravention of a high court order prohibiting this activity. Sujith Bithan said it was a waste of time. Bongumusa Khulekani Mjadu said: “Some municipality officials are a part of land invaders and sellers of municipal land.” Daily News
