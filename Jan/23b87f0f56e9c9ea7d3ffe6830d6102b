DURBAN - The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has cautioned members of the public, parents and prospective students that the registration process is strictly online. UKZN reiterated its warning after the tertiary institution noted with great concern messages being circulated on social media encouraging students and parents to flock to one of our campuses from Monday. Normah Zondo, the executive director of corporate relations at UKZN said: “The university would like to inform members of the public, parents and prospective students that this year’s registration process is strictly online. “As communicated earlier, there is no registration service or registration assistance available on any of our campuses, and therefore, no students or parents will be allowed onto any of the campuses for registration,” said Zondo. Zondo warned against messages encouraging students and parents to go to campuses for registration. “We wish to warn against these messages, which are misleading and irresponsible. Students are urged to abide by the university’s decision and register online,” she said. She added that all registration information is available on www.ukzn.ac.za A chatbot is available to assist. Students requiring further information can call 0800 1000 010. Zondo said UKZN will continue with online teaching and learning until further notice. “Only practical and clinical training will take place face to face,” she said. THE MERCURY
