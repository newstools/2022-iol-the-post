DURBAN - The South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) and its partners were still busy with salvage work on the NS Qingdao vessel which was evacuated from the Port of Durban on October 23, 2021, after her cargo caused a chemical reaction and released toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Samsa spokesperson Tebogo Ramatjie said the vessel was anchored off St Helena Bay and an emergency dumping permit had been obtained from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment to dump the reacting cargo at sea. “Approximately 1 500 tons of cargo will be dumped 250km from the closest point to land and in excess of 3 000m of water. The dumping operation is expected to be concluded on March 15, 2022,” Ramatjie said. “To date more than 1 000 tons of the cargo has been taken out of the vessel and it is expected that the remaining hot spots will be removed and dumped by March 15, 2022.” Ramatjie said the vessel had no obvious structural damage and would return to the closest port after the dumping operation was completed and her cargo was stabilised. “An investigation will also be conducted to determine the reason for the cargo reaction,” he said. “Structural specialists will also conduct an assessment to ensure that the integrity of the vessel is intact before allowing her to sail onward to her destination.” Ramatjie added that the tug Umkhuseli continued to act as a safety standby vessel. The operation was weather dependent to ensure that the highest levels of safety standards were maintained throughout the operation. He said the owners, insurance and salvors continued to work with the South African authorities on the matter. Daily News
