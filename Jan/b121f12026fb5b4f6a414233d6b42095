DURBAN - A Wentworth mother is calling for an end to gun violence in the south Durban community after her near-death experience at her washing line on Wednesday morning. One of the residents in the Hime Street flats captured a video on their cellphone of two men firing a gun between the block of flats and then jogging off.  The zone has 11 blocks of flats.  Previous reports on IOL showed there had been many gang related shooting incidents and murders on Hime Street and adjacent roads, like Woodville Road and Major Culvert Street. Lee Anne Samuels told IOL that she was hanging up clothes on the washing line with her eight-year-old son who was playing around the washing line area and a nearby shipping container that Samuels used to store her possessions.  The container had previously been used as a tuck shop. “I saw this boy come towards me. He looked me in the face and put his hand on the side and drew a gun. I then heard gun shots go off. It happened so quickly and I am glad I had time to react, by taking cover at the side of the flats.” Samuels’ immediate concern was her son, who was close to her, so she screamed out for him. He did not answer and that caused her to panic, as she feared the worst. Meanwhile her son had hidden underneath a car, parked nearby. “I was traumatised, I had a terrible feeling, even though I was lucky to be alive. I found out that the shooters were aiming for some boys on the other end of the flat in the distance. When I went to the clothes line, I saw two holes in one of the washing items. That is how low the bullets were,” Samuels said. She appealed to those involved in such shooting incidents to stop. “My container is peppered with bullet holes, but it saved many people from being killed,” Samuels said. Daily News
