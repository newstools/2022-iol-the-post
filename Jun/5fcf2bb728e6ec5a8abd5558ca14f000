Durban ﹘ A concerned driver has made a public plea to parents, after he captured children on his dash- cam riding on the back of a travelling truck on Milkyway Road in Pinetown. In a traffic Facebook group Raphael Mahumane wrote: “I greet you Ngwenya (Admin), please may you help us in the area of Mariannridge in Pinetown on Milkyway Road. There are children that are seen on the road riding on travelling trucks that are carrying sand. Please can this behaviour be nipped in the bud before these children get seriously injured.” Reacting to the footage Malungy Sokwalisa Dinga said that the children were playing with death asking whether their parents were aware of the game they played. In the footage three children are seen running behind a truck on a slight steep climb, two of them manage to cling onto the back of the truck riding it while travelling, this was while the third fails to catch up to the truck. After a short ride on the back of the truck one child climbs off followed by the second. Sanelisiwe Ngcobo wrote that in KwaMashu children also did the same thing but on the back of moving buses. “Some hold onto the moving bus while on the heels of their feet.” Nuh Makhathini recalled that some years that a child died on this road doing this. “He fell while the truck was moving and it crushed him”. Buyi KamaZuma KaButhelezi wrote that the body whom Makhathini was referring to was her neighbour. “Nuh KamaZuma KaButhelezi, that child was our neighbour, it was painful when his mother was collecting his body on scene. This game is not good at all.” Alice Makhatini wrote that this game was a problem and concern everywhere and parents despite being told about it the children are not stopped from doing this. “And when their children die, they are enraged wanting to assault the driver.” Daily News
