Durban - Siyabonga Mbuso Sotobe Sibiya, 37, was sentenced to 123 years’ imprisonment by the Pietermaritzburg High Court, sitting in Scottburgh, following his conviction on a long list of offences which include housebreaking, theft, robbery, attempted rape, rape and attempted murder. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said the accused committed the offences in the Southport area of Port Shepstone between March 2021, and February 2022. The victims were either in their homes, on their way home or on their way to work when he attacked them, armed with a firearm. He stole the victims’ cellphones, and in the housebreaking counts he stole laptops, wallets, cash and luggage cases while the victims were asleep. He was arrested after he dropped his cellphone at one of the crime scenes and was traced in this way, Ramkisson-Kara said. In court, State advocate Dan Magwaza handed in victim impact statements compiled by some of the victims and facilitated by Court Preparation Officer Khanya Mkhize. The victims said that their experience had left them traumatised and in fear for their lives. “While Sibiya was collectively sentenced to 123 years’ imprisonment, he will serve an effective sentence of 35 years, as some sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The court ordered that he should only be eligible for parole after serving 20 years of his sentence,” Ramkisson-Kara said. Daily News
