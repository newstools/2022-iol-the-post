Durban - Police are alleged to have released two suspects that had been apprehended for stealing concrete fencing from a local clinic in Phoenix, north of Durban, because the complainants refused to open a case. KZN VIP Protection Services spokesperson Gareth Naidoo said that two suspects had been apprehended for the theft of concrete fencing from the Phoenix Clinic boundary walls on Monday afternoon. “The two suspects were seen removing the fencing and tried to hide it along the drain area at the Phoenix Highway and Lenham intersection,” Naidoo said. “The suspects have admitted that someone is paying them R20 per pillar and they would collect it in the evening when it's dark.” Naidoo said that security was also advised from the clinic and they stated that it was not the first time. Suspects were usually apprehended and within days they were back to doing the same thing. He said the KZN VIP services stood by for SAPS on a way forward with the two suspects. Naidoo said: “Hard work goes in vain as the complainants refuse to open a case and the suspects were released by SAPS.” Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
