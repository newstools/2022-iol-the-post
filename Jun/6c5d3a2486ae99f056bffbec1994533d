Durban - DA leader in eThekwini Nicole Graham posted a letter on her Facebook page on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of her last day in the position after she resigned earlier this month. Graham will be leaving her position as the DA caucus leader and as executive committee councillor in the eThekwini Municipality at the end of July to pursue her studies at the University of Sydney in Australia. Graham wrote:  Tomorrow is my last day as the Leader of the DA in eThekwini. We have a full Council meeting and I will lead my team as best as I am able. From Friday, I revert to being an ordinary Executive Committee Councillor. I will remain on the Council and working until the end of July. I am leaving the country at the beginning of August. The DA will call a leadership election in the coming weeks. The new leader will either take up my seat on the Executive Committee or appoint someone to the Executive Committee in accordance with DA processes, depending on who is elected and whether or not they already serve on EXCO. It will be a democratic election so I am not in a position to announce who the person replacing me will be until that process is concluded. That being said, there are plenty of great options and I trust the caucus will make the right decision. I will step back from the Executive Committee as soon as the DA requires me to do so to make the necessary replacements. From Friday, the eThekwini Deputy Leader, Mzamo Billy, will act as Caucus Leader. His email is mzmbilly@gmail.com. I will keep working and doing my best to serve the community until the end of July. I am also doing a number of knowledge sharing and training sessions with the team to ensure that the handover is as smooth as possible. I want to thank you all sincerely for the outpouring of love, support and kindness I have received over the past couple of weeks. It was far more than I could have imagined and I am very grateful. With love, Councillor Nicole Graham THE MERCURY
