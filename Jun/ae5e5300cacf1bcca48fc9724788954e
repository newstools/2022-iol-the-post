DURBAN - A Pietermaritzburg mother did the right thing when she called for help after she saw a snake a short distance from the area where her two young sons were playing at their Chase Valley home on Tuesday. Mi7 National group spokesperson Colin Davids said a distressed client called the Mi7 National Group’s Emergency Medical Services on Tuesday afternoon, after she spotted an unidentified snake in her yard. “The client, who could not identify the species, rightfully took no chances with regards to the safety of her family and requested that the snake be removed from the premises,” he said. Davids said Mi7 Rescue teams, who are trained in snake handling, were immediately dispatched to the home. “They found an infant puff adder, which was successfully captured and safely relocated to another area,” Davids said. Davids warned that puff adders, even as infants, are venomous and pose a danger to humans and pets.   Last month, Mi7 National group removed a puff adder from a Clarendon resident’s garden. “The animal was safely captured and relocated,” Davids said. Local Durban snake rescuer, Nick Evans, said snakes serve an important role in our environment. He said snakes control the numbers of many different animals, and they’re a food source for other animals. “It can be extremely dangerous to kill snakes, as they will want to defend themselves,” Evans said. He advised that it is always best to call a professional to remove a snake. THE MERCURY
