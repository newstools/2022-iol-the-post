Durban - A suspect was caught in the act while attempting to flee through a hole in a door of a business he had broken into in Glen Anil, Durban North, on Sunday. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell, said the Emergency Dispatch Centre was alerted to a business in progress on Glen Anil Street at about 7am. Powell said Armed Response Officers were dispatched and arrived at the business about four minutes later. “Upon the arrival of our Armed Response Officers, one suspect was caught trying to escape from a door which had been forced open. “The suspect failed to escape and was immediately arrested by our Armed Response Officers,”he said. He said Greenwood Park SAPS were informed, and arrived on the scene a short while later. Powell said the owner of the business premises was informed of the incident and proceeded to open a case against the suspect. “The suspect was handed over to Greenwood Park SAPS and will be charged for business break-in,” he added. Last month, Marshall Security announced that in the first two weeks of May, 133 incidents were reported to the Emergency Dispatch Centre. Powell said this was approximately 10 incidents a week more than the average incident rate the security company recorded during April 2022. He said the top three types of incidents for the month were housebreakings, calls for medical assistance and theft. “We are happy to report that the top three areas which have been victim to trio crimes – Avoca, Effingham and Kenville, saw a decrease in these incidents,”he said. With regard to crime trends, Powell said Umdloti experienced a sharp increase in incidents compared to the norm, with three armed robberies contributing to the 10 incidents reported over the first two weeks of the month. “There were also multiple courier vehicle related crimes, and we urge drivers to be extra vigilant following recent incidents,” he said.
