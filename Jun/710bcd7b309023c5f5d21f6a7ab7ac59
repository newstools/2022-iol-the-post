Durban - A Durban traffic officer will be appearing in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Monday for perjury and defeating the ends of justice after he falsely claimed that he was held up by armed robbers outside his home in Savannah Park, Pinetown. Provincial police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo, said Mariannhill police arrested the 46-year-old traffic officer following a false case that he reported on June 8, 2022, at the Mariannhill police station. Ngcobo said it was alleged that the suspect reported that he was returning from work when he was approached by three unknown men outside his house in Savannah Park. “He was held up by the suspects who demanded his service pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition,” she said. The docket was allocated to an investigating officer who investigated the matter further, she said. However, Ngcobo said during the investigation it was established that there were contradictions in the man’s statement. She said the complainant was re-interviewed and it was discovered that he had reported a false case. Police informed the man that making a false statement is a criminal offence. “It was established by the investigating officer that he had lost his firearm and did not report the matter to his employer,” said Ngcobo. Ngcobo said he was arrested and detained at the Mariannhill police station. “We are appealing to the members of the community to refrain from opening false cases. It is a criminal offence to lie under oath and those who do so will face the full might of the law,” said SAPS. THE MERCURY
