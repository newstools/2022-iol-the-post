Durban - This morning, the Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment (PACT) centre staff woke up to devastating news that a fire had broken out and gutted dog kennels at the Puppy SOS KZN premises last night. In a Facebook post, PACT wrote: “This morning we woke up to the devastating news that a fire had broken...we were relieved to hear that all the animals and staff had miraculously escaped”.   The organisation says, since the floods, they have spent time and effort sourcing food and supplies to rebuild the damage the floods had left behind. “The floods destroyed all the food and structures, and it's taken us forever to re-build this. The only vehicle used to transport animals to and from the vet and township is gone,” they said. PACT says they rushed to the kennels as soon as they heard the news, and they said some of the animals were covered in ash and showed signs of anxiety. They say most of the animals (120 dogs and 30 puppies) were inside the house, but a handful of dogs were outside in the only room not destroyed by floods next to where the fire broke out. The animal centre needs food donations, building supplies and foster homes. Contact PACT and Puppy SOS KZN on pact4068@gmail.com and puppysoskzn@gmail.com THE MERCURY
