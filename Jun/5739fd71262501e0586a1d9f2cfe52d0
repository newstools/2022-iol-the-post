Durban - Armed suspects robbed three Verulam families in their homes, two were neighbours and the third just 2km away, on Tuesday morning. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said at this stage it is unclear whether the incidents are linked or not. Gwala said it was alleged that at 8.30am, a group of armed men accosted two neighbours on Cottonwood Drive in Trenance Park. “At gunpoint they robbed the victims of cash, cellphone, laptops, jewellery and drove away in the complainant’s silver grey vehicle,” she said.   The vehicle was later recovered at Inanda in Dube Village, she said. Gwala said while the police were still busy at the scene they received a complaint that a family on Kingfisher Road in Verulam had been robbed by armed suspects. “The suspects took cash, jewellery, cellphones and fled the scene,” she said. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the neighbours on Cottonwood Drive were robbed simultaneously by about 10 armed suspects. He said the suspects were in a silver VW Polo and another unknown vehicle. The suspects forcefully gained entry into both homes which are on an adjoining property, he said. “A grey VW Tiguan was taken by the suspects,” he said.   Balram said Rusa officers at the scene were notified that a third home was robbed 12 minutes earlier in Dawncrest. “Members of Rusa were dispatched to a residence. On arrival, it was established that at least 10 suspects forced their way into the house. They ransacked the home in search of valuables,” he said. According to Balram, the robbers also entered a CMT (cut, make, trim) clothing manufacturing factory operating at the back of the premises. “The staff locked themselves in the toilet when they realised the premises was being robbed. The robbers stole several handbags, a TV, cellphones and jewellery,” he said. Police said three counts of house robbery are being investigated by Verulam police.   THE MERCURY
