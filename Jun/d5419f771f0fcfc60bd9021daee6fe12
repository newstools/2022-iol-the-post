DURBAN – Police responded to a shooting on Thursday afternoon outside a hospital in Sydenham, which claimed the life of one person.  It is believed that the victim's vehicle, a white Mercedes, was parked outside the Lenmed Shifa Private Hospital, when another vehicle drove past and gunmen opened fire. The occupant of the vehicle was killed. A source with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named, said that the shooting was believed to be drug related and linked to the turf war between two rival drug gangs.  “There is an ongoing drug war between a Cape Town gang and a gang from Sydenham. The war is all about territory and who can have the most territory to operate their business. “There were numerous rounds of gunshots fired, at least 30, and high-calibre guns were used such as an AK-47.” The source added that there were fears that there could be further shootings in retaliation after the incident.  “There is a concern that there could be revenge attacks.” The police have been approached for comment.
