Durban - After netting 50 crates of sardines at eManzimtoti Beach on Monday morning, seasoned Durban angler Jace Govender is on a boat out at sea, attempting to net a larger shoal of sardines. Speaking to “The Mercury” while 800 metres out at sea off eManzimtoti Beach, Govender said while the wind was not that strong, the sea swells were quite big, which makes netting difficult. He said he had one small netting of 50 crates on Monday morning.   Govender said four nets were dropped at Warner Beach yesterday, one in Hibberdene on Saturday and four in Margate on Friday. A further two nets were also dropped at eManzimtoti, he said.   “There is lots of shark action. There were big sharks at Warner Beach on the lower South Coast,” added Govender. Beaches still remain closed to the public on the Durban coastline due to high E coli levels following the April floods, reported IOL. The eThekwini Municipality warned communities to avoid all contact (swimming, fishing, recreational and sporting activities, as well as traditional activities) with water in rivers or streams, as this may result in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, typhoid, cholera, and other waterborne diseases. With this in mind, Govender said they are taking precautionary measures by staying away from river mouths and discoloured water. He said fishing was taking place in open waters. Govender added: “So far all signs point to a good sardine run this year.” THE MERCURY
