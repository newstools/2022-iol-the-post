Durban — The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has assured South Africans, especially those living along the country’s borders, that it would continue to make sure that the borders are protected and secured. Spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said this in response to a video that has been circulating on social media and news platforms alleging that members of AfriForum had taken over the responsibility of border patrols. Dlamini refuted this, saying:“It must be stated that the Constitution of the Republic mandates the SANDF to protect and secure the territorial integrity of the Republic and will do so by making sure that the country’s land, air and sea borders are protected and secured. “ It is the responsibility of the SANDF to maintain all borderline integrity of the country and not any other non-state grouping or groups. Therefore the responsibility of borderline patrols belongs to the SANDF which is a statutory law enforcement agency, and this responsibility cannot be ceded to business, NGOs or organisations.” Dlamini reiterated a Department of Home Affairs’ statement   saying that it was illegal for any civil or non governmental organisation, or business, to conduct patrols at any borders of the Republic of South Africa. “The SANDF wants to assure all South Africans, in particular, those living along the borders that it will continue to secure the borderline and will work with those communities namely; farmers, traditional leaders, business and community in general to ensure that there is a coordinated effort to curb cross border crime. However, it will not shed its responsibility given by the constitution to protect and secure the integrity of the Republic to anybody or organisation,” Dlamini said. Daily News
