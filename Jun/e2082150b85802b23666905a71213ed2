Durban - Two Verulam residents escaped serious injury in two separate incidents involving a rogue metal trolley and a stray bullet which entered a residence through the window and landed in the door of a fridge. In the first incident, an unattended metal trolley on Moss Street in the Verulam CBD was knocked by a vehicle which caused it to collide with an unsuspecting male pedestrian who was walking on the pavement. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said members on patrol were flagged down for assistance just after 4.30pm on Wednesday. Balram said it was established that an SUV knocked into a trolley that was on the road. “The metal trolley then struck the pedestrian who was walking on the pavement,” he said. According to reports, Balram said the vehicle continued without stopping to render assistance. “The pedestrian sustained minor injuries and did not require medical attention,” he said.   Meanwhile, Rusa reported on Thursday that a resident living on Shari Drive in Everest Heights discovered that his fridge was struck by a stray bullet. Balram said the homeowner contacted Rusa yesterday afternoon just after 6pm after he discovered the bullet. “On arrival, he informed Reaction Officers that on Sunday (June 5) he found his kitchen window shattered. He assumed that one of the residents in the area was scaring off monkeys with a slingshot and accidentally damaged his window. He replaced the window on Monday morning. “Yesterday (Wednesday), he noticed a hole in the side of his fridge and upon further investigation located the bullet,” he said. Balram said the homeowner recalled hearing multiple shots being fired in the area on Sunday morning. He said it could not be confirmed who fired the shots.     THE MERCURY
