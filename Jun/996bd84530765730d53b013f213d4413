Durban — Two suspects arrested for drug dealing in Phoenix, north of Durban, are expected to appear in court again on Friday for a bail application. The pair, aged 25 and 31, were arrested for drug dealing on Monday by the Port Shepstone Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Durban K9 Unit and Durban Metro Police Drug Team. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the pair appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. “They were returned to police cells and will appear again on Friday for a bail application,” Mhlongo said. He said that before the arrest, officers had received information about the suspects dealing in drugs at Ricemore Close in Phoenix. An intelligence-driven operation was conducted and members proceeded to the area. “Observations were made and the suspects were intercepted. Their vehicle was searched and 1 610 heroin capsules to the street value of approximately R32 200 were found,” Mhlongo said. Daily News
