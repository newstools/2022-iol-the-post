DURBAN - The eThekwini Municipality says beaches remain closed and the public is advised to avoid all contact with water in rivers, including traditional activities until further notice due to high e-coli levels. “The municipality wishes to remind the public that due to the recent floods, there has been significant damage to the wastewater treatment plants and sanitation infrastructure (sewage network and pump stations) across the municipality which has resulted in sewerage pollution in many rivers,” said eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela. According to Mayisela Wastewater Networks and Sanitation Operations had repaired minor sewer infrastructure faults and were fast-tracking the repairs to major sewer infrastructure through the Disaster Procurement Forum. “In the interests of public health, communities are advised to avoid all contact (swimming, fishing, recreational and sporting activities as well as traditional activities) with water in rivers or streams as this may result in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, typhoid, cholera and other water-borne related diseases,” Mayisela said. “The City apologises for any inconvenience and assures the public that it is doing everything within its power to fast track the repairs of the damaged infrastructure.” The sea pollution and beach closures have also led to the postponement of the Oceans 8 Charity Swim scheduled for June 17 and 18. “We need to keep the safety of our participants as our main priority, and the current e-coli levels in the water are very high because of the damage of numerous waste treatment plants. Major infrastructure repairs need to be done and these are unlikely to be completed in the near future,” said event co-ordinator Hilary Bruss. The new dates for the event are November 4 - 5 (6).
