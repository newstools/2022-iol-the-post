Durban: A woman who went missing in the early hours of Saturday morning in Salt Rock on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast was later found disoriented in the Glendale area, 44 minutes away. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said that on Saturday, IPSS Medical Search and Rescue were advised that a woman and her dog had gone missing in the early hours of the morning. Meyrick said the woman's dog was found safe and taken to the Aloe Veterinary Clinic in Ballito, but there was no sign of her. IPSS Medical Search and Rescue volunteers, together with Quinton Power from National Sea Rescue Institute Ballito, were activated, he said. Meyrick said that in the early evening, information was received that the woman, who is known to The Mercury only as Yvonne, was lost in the rural area of Glendale.   He said contact was made with a local authority official, Gladys Gumede who confirmed that the woman had been found. “Gladys and the local community had found Yvonne disorientated and had taken her in, keeping her warm and safe until teams could arrive. “Yvonne was then escorted to a hospital by Search and Rescue members as well as the Maphumulo SAPS where she will be cared for until her son arrives from Johannesburg.”  Meyrick thanked all involved and especially the Gumedes from the Glendale area.
