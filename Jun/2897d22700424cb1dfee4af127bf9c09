Durban — The Estcourt, northern KwaZulu-Natal cash-in-transit (CIT) heist court case has been postponed for further investigation. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Nomthandazo Mbambo said: “The two suspects, Robert Mbongiseni Manyoni and Siyabonga Ncube appeared at Estcourt Magistrate’s Court and the case was postponed for further investigation to June 20, 2022.” The two appeared in court on Monday after being arrested by the Hawks for a CIT heist earlier this month. After the arrest, Mbambo said that on Wednesday, June 8, three security officers travelling in an armoured vehicle were allegedly ambushed by eight men on the R103 outside Estcourt. “Suspects allegedly opened fire on the guards and robbed them of their official firearms. They then tried to blow open the cash van but couldn’t access the money and only a small amount of money was damaged due to the explosion. “The two injured security guards were referred to the hospital for treatment,” Mbambo said. Mbambo said that the following day, on June 9, the Pietermaritzburg DPCI National Priority Crimes Investigation, Pietermaritzburg Bomb Squad and K9, DPCI Provincial Tracing team and National Intervention Unit Field team operationalised information received and arrested two suspects in the Estcourt area. “(A) preliminary investigation led to a house of another suspect where exhibits suspected to have been used in other CIT-related crimes were found and seized. The said suspect is still sought by the police,” Mbambo said. Meanwhile, DA uThukela District constituency head, Alf Lees said the third suspect was a high-ranking politician in a local municipality in the province. Lees said the two suspects had pointed out the politician’s house as the place where the CIT was planned. The politician followed the vehicle that was ambushed on the day the CIT took place.
