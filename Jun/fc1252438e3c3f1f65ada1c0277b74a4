Durban - Two women and a man were arrested on Friday for possession of 50 SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards after their suspicious behaviour at an ATM in the Roseneath area in Umkomaas was reported to police. Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said that just after 8am on Friday, a security official at the ATM noticed that the trio were acting suspiciously. Gwala said the official decided to join the ATM queue to monitor them. “The suspects were observed with numerous Sassa cards and bank cards that they were using to withdraw cash,” she said. She said when the trio realised that they were being watched, they fled in their vehicle. Police officers from Umkomaas SAPS were contacted and the vehicle was monitored, she said. Gwala said the suspects moved to another ATM and the vehicle was spotted in the parking lot. “The suspects were spotted withdrawing money at the ATM. As they returned to their vehicle, police were waiting for them,” she said. She said the three suspects, aged between 25 and 45, were found with 50 Sassa cards, 20 Easy pay cards and R34 000 in cash. “It was established that the suspects had transferred R360 000 into a private bank account,” said Gwala. All three suspects were placed under arrest for possession of stolen property. Gwala said more charges are expected to be added. “They are expected to appear before the Scottburgh Magistrate’s Court on Monday,  June 6,” she said.
