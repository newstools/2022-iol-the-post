Durban - A neighbour in Durban has indicated that she would be moving after a sixth black mamba was removed from Reservoir Hills in five weeks. On Wednesday, snake catcher Nick Evans said he received a call about a snake where he had recently captured five mambas in a month. He said that usually at the property, the mambas were sprawled out on beams on the side of the property. You look down on them. “Well, today (Wednesday), everyone’s worst fears came true – one of the mambas had come up to where one stands! One staff member has a room there. The mamba was at her doorway,” Evans said. “The mamba saw people and went under a shipping container. My hopes weren’t high.” He said the space it squeezed under was tiny. “I couldn’t believe it got under there. Then, to my amazement, I saw it! Its body was sticking out of the side of the container,” Evans said. He said at the same time it was incredibly frustrating as the gap was far too small for him to do anything. “I got a hosepipe and stuck it under there. This got it moving, and it was keen to come out,” Evans recalled. “I ended up getting a hold of the tail. But that’s all. It just wouldn’t budge. I waited and waited. “I tried poking its front half with my hook. “Then, I tried the hose and running water. That did the trick! The mamba quickly reversed out of there, and I had it secure,” Evans said. He said the mamba was a male, the biggest of the four he caught there. It was about 2.5m in length. “Yes, he was very likely there looking for the large female that I removed the other day,” Evans said. He said he thought the staff enjoyed the excitement and he was always grateful they called. However, he did not think the woman who lived there was too happy. “I spoke to the neighbour. She said she’s moving,” Evans said. Daily News
