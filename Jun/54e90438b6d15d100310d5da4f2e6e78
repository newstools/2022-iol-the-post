Durban - A reaction officer was left in critical condition after he was shot multiple times on Wednesday evening in Durban. ALS Paramedics Medical Services spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said a reaction officer was in a critical condition following a shooting incident on Lyttleton Avenue in Reservoir Hills just after 8pm. “ALS Paramedics Medical Services arrived together with Netcare 911 on the scene to find that a reaction officer believed to be in his forties had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his body in a shooting incident,” Jamieson said. “The officer was in a critical condition and was stabilised on the scene by advanced life support paramedics before being rushed to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment that he required.” According to Inkosi Security Services, they received reports of shots fired in Lyttleton Avenue and their response team was immediately dispatched. When they arrived on the scene, they found that an ADT response officer was shot multiple times in the legs and stomach while he was on patrol in the area. It is alleged that two vehicles were used by approximately six suspects, a silver Mercedes-Benz hatchback and a white unknown vehicle. One of the vehicles is believed to be the same vehicle used at the Nola Terrace shooting on June 6, where Inkosi response officers were also shot at. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said a case of attempted murder is being investigated by the Sydenham SAPS. “It is alleged that a 46-year-old security guard was on duty when an unknown vehicle opened fire towards him. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to the hospital for medical attention.” Last week, a reaction officer was shot by fleeing suspects who had allegedly robbed a Newlands West family. The officer was shot in the abdomen. Daily News
