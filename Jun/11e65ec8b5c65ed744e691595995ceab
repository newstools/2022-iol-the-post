Durban - Canaan College has expelled a pupil who was allegedly, in a video, captured slapping another pupil.  In a 22-second video, a Grade 10 pupil is seen slapping another Grade 10 schoolmate in a place that looked like a school toilet. The video started circulating this week but the school said the incident happened two weeks ago. This was confirmed to the Daily News by the owner of the college, Nhlanhla Khambule, on Sunday. He said he could not tolerate any form of bullying in his school therefore the management decided to expel the alleged perpetrator from the school, saying he was not even interested in what had led to the incident but the alleged bully was wrong and nothing could justify what he had allegedly done. "My school was built on Christian values therefore any form of bad behaviour can not be tolerated which is why we acted in this way. We want to send a message to everyone who bullies other pupils that bad behaviour will not be tolerated. As a school built on entrepreneurship values embedded in Christian ethos we instil in our pupils the utmost importance of respect for humanity so as a result of the incident after due process, the pupil was expelled," said Khambule.  Education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said although it was a private school, after seeing the video the department called the principal to find out what was going on, and he told them he had expelled the alleged perpetrator.  The college is the first private school in Umlazi and offers classes from Grade R to matric. Daily News
