Durban — An off-duty police officer and community apprehended three robbery suspects in Riet River, Verulam, north of Durban. It is alleged the suspects had robbed a woman who was returning to her home in Zwelisha on Saturday afternoon. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the domestic worker, 29, was walking along Tottenham Road in Riet River when she noticed three males standing on the pavement. They greeted her as she approached. “One of the men produced a knife while his two accomplices attempted to grab her. The woman threw her Hisense cellphone on the road and fled to a nearby tuckshop where she sought assistance from an off-duty policeman from Greenwood Park SAPS. The officer with the assistance of the community pursued the robbers on foot,” Balram said. He said Rusa received a call for assistance at approximately 3.55pm from a passer-by who witnessed the chase. “On arrival, reaction officers discovered that all three suspects were apprehended. The victim’s cellphone, a knife and ATM cards suspected to have been stolen in a separate robbery were recovered,” Balram said. He said the robbers were placed under arrest and detained at Verulam SAPS. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo confirmed the incident. “The three suspects aged 19 and 20 will appear at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, June 21, 2022.” Daily News
