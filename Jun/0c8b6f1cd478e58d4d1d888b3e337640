DURBAN - A 17-year-old Grade 10 learner from Waterloo Secondary School was stabbed by suspects on a railway line in Temple Valley, Verulam, on Wednesday afternoon.  The incident follows a 17-year-old learner being stabbed to death at Siphesihle Secondary School in Verulam in February. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson, said that according to the victim, four other learners were walking towards a store to purchase airtime when four suspects wearing masks approached them and demanded valuables.  “The suspects were all armed with Okapi knives. When they found no valuables they walked away and returned a minute later and stabbed the student walking at the back of the group.” Balram added that paramedics treated the victim for a stab wound to his back. In a separate incident, IOL reported in February that a 17-year-old school learner was stabbed to death after an altercation at Siphesihle Secondary School in Verulam.  Balram said in that incident, RUSA members were called by teachers to the school, requesting assistance for the critically injured male.  “On arrival, RUSA officers were informed that the critically injured student was transported privately to a local clinic where he was declared deceased on arrival.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala had said at the time that it was alleged that a group of learners were fighting inside the school in Trenance Park. “During the fight, a 17-year-old male was stabbed on the left side of the chest. He was taken to a local clinic where he was declared dead upon arrival. A case of murder is being investigated by Verulam SAPS.” THE MERCURY
