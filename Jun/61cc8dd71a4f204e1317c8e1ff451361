Durban: A taxi fee increase notice was issued by Alfred Duma Local Municipality to alert councillors and stakeholders of the Klip River Taxi Association’s proposed increases. The municipality said the ward committee members assigned to the Transport Forum Committee needed to be provided with the notice in order to prepare themselves for the negotiations. The negotiations were due to be held next week, once the Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison had confirmed the date of the stakeholders’ meeting it said. “Every ward affected by the increase in terms of the Klip River Taxi Association transport routes needs to convene a meeting within the ward to obtain a mandate from their respective constituency. “Once that is done, the broader negotiations committee will be available to attend meetings which are cluster based, to clarify and respond where there are disputes,” said the municipality. The municipality said the process needed to be done appropriately through adequate consultation. “No politics are aligned to this programme. Hence, it needs to be managed accordingly for the benefit of the community,” it said. Written submissions can be also directed to the Klip River Taxi Association Office or the Speakers Office at Alfred Duma Local Municipality during office hours at Town Hall. “As council, we trust that all affected ward boundaries will adhere and process this request through trust and loyalty,” said the municipality.
