Durban - Opposition parties have criticised the eThekwini Municipality for spending almost R200 000 on sponsorship for a golf day event. The report on the matter stated the proposed golf day initiative event was aimed at raising funds to support the families that have been affected by the floods. The city spent R190 000 to sponsor the event.  The event took place on Wednesday and the discussions came after the fact at a council meeting on Thursday.  Opposition party councillors said it does not make sense for the city to “donate” towards an event in order to get people to donate to the flood victims. Others raised concerns that they are speaking on the issue a day after the event took place. IFP councillor Mzwethu Gwala said the money could have been given directly to the victims as that could have meant a lot of change in their lives. “You cannot donate more than R100 000 while we are still busy dealing with the floods. It does not make any sense to donate to people who plan to donate to the victims of the floods,” he said. An ANC councillor said such events could be used to develop the interest of golf within the black community. Another ANC councillor said the funds raised will help a lot of people who were affected by the floods. THE MERCURY
