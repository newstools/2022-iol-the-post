Durban - A 27-year-old Hillcrest woman was set to appear again in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court next month charged with fraud against her previous employer. It is alleged that in May and October 2021 Jagruti Kapitan falsely and with the intent to defraud Africq Fibre Company by claiming that Grashyo Creations and Grashyo Health Safety and Innovative Technology were owed R792 537.50, prepared invoices to substantiate the claim which led Africq Fibre to pay the amount. The State further alleges that the accused knew Grashyo Creations and Grashyo Health Safety and Innovative Technology were not clients nor debtors of the aforesaid company. It said that the invoices presented by the accused were not due and payable. “The accused benefited from paying out these amounts to the aforesaid companies as these amounts were paid to her,” alleges the State. She appeared in court on Tuesday and the matter was adjourned to July 25 for further investigation. In January when Kapitan was applying for bail, her defence attorney, N Panday, told the court that she could afford R2 000 bail, had no previous convictions or pending cases, was unmarried and had no children. Her bail, which the State did not oppose, was set at R10 000. Daily News
