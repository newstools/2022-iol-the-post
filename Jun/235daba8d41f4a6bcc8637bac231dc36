Durban — As of Wednesday, KwaZulu-Natal’s load shedding schedule will be changed by Eskom from even hours to odd hours. To enhance the system stability during load shedding, a change in schedule is needed which will ensure an improved customer experience, Eskom said on Tuesday. Eskom KZN Industry Support and Stakeholder Management Joyce Zingoni said: “The schedules will be updated tonight (Tuesday) at midnight, and Eskom customers will be able to access the new load shedding schedules from tomorrow (Wednesday).” “However, customers that are supplied by municipalities that undertake their own load shedding might not be affected by this change immediately.” “Eskom urges them to consult their local municipalities to confirm their schedules,” continued Zingoni. Eskom apologised for any inconvenience caused. Meanwhile, earlier, DA caucus leader Nicole Graham reported that the municipality would not load shed even if Eskom moved to stage 6 load shedding. IOL reported that in an urgent briefing called by the power utility on Tuesday morning, De Ruyter announced that Eskom would probably be forced to implement stage 6 load shedding because unlawful and unprotected labour action at a number of power stations had caused delays in carrying out planned maintenance and repairs. In a Facebook post, Graham said: “Even if we move to stage 6, eThekwini is still not load shedding. There is another Eskom/eThekwini meeting tomorrow (Wednesday), but good news for now.” “For those from other areas, this is not mere kindness from Eskom. We are using around 200MW less than we used to (compared to this time last year) and our infrastructure is also very compromised. Many people assume this is just a friendly arrangement.” Load shedding has not been implemented in the municipality since the April floods. Daily News
