Durban - The family of missing Pietermaritzburg man, Deenadayalan Sivalingam, also known as Anand, are appealing for any information regarding his whereabouts. Sivalingam travelled with a friend to Durban last month but did not return to Pietermaritzburg with him. Sivalingam's niece, Pam Thaver, said her family are desperate to find her uncle who was last seen wearing black pants, a blue jacket with ‘SPORT’ written on the side and a white cap. She said her 68-year-old uncle, who lives in Copesville, is approximately 1.6 metres tall and weighs 50 kgs. Thaver said Sivalingam accompanied a friend to Durban on May 19, 2022 and has not made contact with his family since. “The friend returned to Pietermaritzburg on 20 May 2022 without my uncle. When questioned we were told he left him at the Durban bus station,” she said. Thaver said the family believe Sivalingam could be in Kenville or the Durban central area. “We have searched most of the Pietermaritzburg and Durban areas, to no avail. My uncle has a 93-year-old mum and four sisters in their 60’s who are extremely worried about him,” she said. Thaver said the family opened an enquiry at the Mountain Rise Police Station on May 22.
