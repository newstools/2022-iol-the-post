Durban - A 34-year-old taxi driver was shot by an alleged robber while seated in his minibus taxi at the Mslasini Taxi Rank in the Everest Heights area of Verulam on Saturday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said at approximately 6.44pm, a black Toyota Quantum drove to the Rusa headquarters seeking medical attention for the gunshot victim. Balram said medics examined the individual and discovered that he had been fatally injured. He said it was alleged that the man was seated alone in the minibus when he was approached by the suspect who produced a firearm. “The victim attempted to flee by jumping from his seat to the rear and exiting through the sliding door when two shots were fired. He collapsed a few metres away from the vehicle,” he said. Balram said the suspect fled with cash. He added that a person known to the man loaded him into the taxi and drove to the Rusa offices. Provincial police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said a case of murder is being investigated by the Verulam police. “It is alleged that yesterday (Saturday), a 34-year-old taxi driver was on the side of the road when an unknown man appeared on the driver’s side and fired one shot at the driver,” she said.
