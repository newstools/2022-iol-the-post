The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in KwaZulu-Natal will embark on a protest on Friday to highlight the impact of the rising cost of living, particularly as a result of the increased fuel prices. The protest also aims to raise the issue of the high unemployment rate among youth as well as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for the first quarter of 2022 as provided by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the unemployment rate was 63,9% for those aged 15-24 and 42,1% for those aged 25-34 years, while the current official national rate stands at 34,5%.  Fuel prices also rose at the beginning of June, leaving many citizens distraught. Edwin Mkhize, COSATU KZN secretary, said the protest will start at Curries Fountain Stadium in Durban from 10am. Thereafter, there will be a motorcade proceeding to the Marine Building in Durban City Centre.  Mkhize said the protest will be peaceful, and that members of COSATU will hand a memorandum over to authorities. He said the high cost of living was alarming and bode ill for the country. “There should be more political will and a better use of resources by leaders.” He called on government to stick to its promises of creating a better economy. Mkhize called for a job summit to be held to discuss the many challenges facing South Africans such as the increase in VAT, tariffs, fuel and the rising of debt. He said: “Private businesses should be conscientised to give back more to the suffering communities in the country”. When asked about the confusion surrounding the national shutdown that was reportedly set to take place on June 10, Mkhize stated that COSATU did not organise that shutdown and was not approached by any organisations regarding it. He said the protest planned for this June 17 is spearheaded by COSATU and that a number of other organisations would join the protest in support of addressing the rising cost of living in the country.
