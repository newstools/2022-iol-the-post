Durban - While others mocked two drivers who shared a video of themselves popping fuel pills into their petrol tanks before refilling, saying that it helped save money on petrol, others warned of the consequences. One of the drivers in the video starts her vehicle showing her fuel gage which shows that she has petrol for 80km. In the video, the driver pops in the pill before the petrol attendant refills her car. “Pour it, when its full I’ll drive in it and will show what happens to the kilometres. With your R100 you can buy the pill, fill up and boom you’re ready to go, it boosts the engine and performance,” she says in isiZulu. In the second video, a male driver says: “This is the pill I’ve been telling you about, I pop in half because I pour in half the tank, it will save me petrol.” Reacting to the videos on Facebook, Nhlanhla Innocent Gumede wrote that he had used the pill before. “This pill is old, I know it from the time I used to drive long-distance taxis. Its effects are not good, it’s a good idea that if you buy it you also save money for an engine overhaul.” Thulani Mkhize, reacting to the video, asked where he could get the pill as he needed it, while Wiseman Majozi wrote that he knew the pill from a long time ago, warning drivers. “It’s not good and they know but they also know that due to increasing petrol prices we will believe anything,” said Majozi.
