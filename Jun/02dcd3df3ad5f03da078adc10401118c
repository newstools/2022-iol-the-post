Durban - A man has been arrested for house breaking after he was caught in the roof of a Durban North house. Marshall Security said an alert neighbour on Ryde Place in Durban North saw a man breaking into another property and called them for assistance. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said the Emergency Dispatch Centre received a call just before 8am on Friday morning. Powell said armed response officers were dispatched and arrived on the scene within three minutes. “Upon their arrival, our officers noticed that the roof tiles of the house were displaced and suspected that the housebreaker could possibly be hiding out in the ceiling of the property,” he said. He said officers found a ladder to get onto the roof of the house.   “The suspect was quickly uncovered and immediately arrested,” said Powell. Powell said the suspect, who lives in a nearby informal settlement, had allegedly admitted to being involved in the previous copper theft incident at the same property. Powell said the homeowner was informed about the incident and proceeded to open a case against the suspect. “Greenwood Park SAPS were dispatched and arrived on scene a short while later, where the suspect was handed over to them for further investigating a case of housebreaking,” he said.
