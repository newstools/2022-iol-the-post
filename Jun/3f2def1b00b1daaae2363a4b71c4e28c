Durban — A security officer sustained a gunshot wound to his leg after he was robbed and shot by suspects while on his way to work. KZN VIP Protection Services spokesperson Gareth Naidoo said the man was robbed in the early hours of Friday morning in the Bester area near Phoenix Industrial Park, north of Durban. “KZN VIP responded to the scene to find the victim with a gunshot wound to the leg. The victim stated he was accosted by two African male suspects who demanded all his goods,” Naidoo said. “The suspects became aggressive and shot the security officer because he only had a phone worth R200 on him and bus fare of approximately R30 to return home.” Naidoo said the suspects fled in an unknown direction. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said they checked with KwaMashu SAPS and Ntuzuma SAPS but the police stations did not have a report on the incident. Daily News
