Durban – The DA in the eThekwini Municipality has reported that the municipality would not load shed even if Eskom moved to stage 6 load shedding. DA caucus leader Nicole Graham provided an update on load shedding after Eskom chief executive Andre de Ruyter said the risk of moving to stage 6 load shedding was high and would be confirmed by 2pm. IOL reported that in an urgent briefing called by the power utility on Tuesday morning, De Ruyter announced that Eskom would probably be forced to implement stage 6 load shedding because unlawful and unprotected labour action at a number of power stations had caused delays in carrying out planned maintenance and repairs. The full staff complement had not reported for duty at a number of power stations. As a result, generation losses had not been reduced as planned, which had compelled Eskom to consider raising the load-shedding stage, he said. eThekwini load shedding update 💡Even if we move to stage 6, eThekwini is still not load shedding. There is another ESKOM/ eThekwini meeting tomorrow, but good news for now. In a Facebook post, Graham said: “Even if we move to stage 6, eThekwini is still not load shedding. There is another Eskom/ eThekwini meeting tomorrow (Wednesday), but good news for now.” “For those from other areas, this is not mere kindness from Eskom. We are using around 200MW less than we used to (compared to this time last year) and our infrastructure is also very compromised. Many people assume this is just a friendly arrangement.” Load shedding has not been implemented in the municipality since the April floods. In essence, stage 6 load shedding means that South Africans will experience about six hours of power cuts in a day. Daily News
