Durban — Animal protection organisations have called on animal owners to keep all animals with sufficient shelter and warmth as cold fronts continue to sweep through South Africa. The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) said that if people felt cold while wearing layers of clothing while inside their houses, then they should imagine how cold it was for animals left outside without any shelter. The NSPCA said it was freezing cold across the country as temperatures plummet to below freezing in certain parts. “All animal owners (domestic animals, farm animals, wildlife etc) are reminded to provide adequate shelter from adverse weather conditions.  “This is a requirement by law. “Bring your animals inside, or provide adequate shelter and protection from the cold conditions. Leaving a blanket outside is not sufficient. “Please report animals that are left out in the cold without shelter to your local SPCA.  “Your details will remain anonymous if necessary,” the NSPCA said. The Kloof and Highway SAPS said that with warnings of a cold front fast approaching, it wanted to remind pet owners to ensure their pets had sufficient shelter and warmth. “If you are cold - your pet is cold! It is your responsibility to ensure your pets are safe and warm at all times.” For any welfare concerns please the Kloof and Highway SPCA on 031 764 1212 or 073 335 9322 or email at controller@kloofspca.co.za.
