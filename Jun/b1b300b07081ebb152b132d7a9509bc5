Durban - A tracking company, private security and police recovered a vehicle that was stolen during a home invasion, 15 minutes after activation. The vehicle, a silver VW Tiguan, was stolen during an armed home invasion in Verulam, north of Durban, on Tuesday morning. Marshall Security director Tyron Powell said members of their special operations team and Tracker SA recovered the vehicle within 15 minutes of ground teams being notified of the incident. Powell said that around 9.10am, the Marshall Security ops team were activated to assist Tracker SA with locating the VW that had been stolen by an unknown number of armed suspects. “Our members immediately responded to the last known location of the stolen vehicle which was recovered together with Tracker SA and assisted by the Marshall Special Ops Team, Verulam SAPS and other security companies within 15 minutes of being activated,” Powell said. He added the scene was secured and would be investigated further by the police. Earlier, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram had reported two families had been robbed simultaneously. Balram said that two families living on Cottonwood Drive in Trenance Park had been robbed at the same time by about 10 armed suspects. “Suspects in a silver VW Polo and another unknown vehicle forced themselves onto the premises and entered the home at 9.03am (on Tuesday) and held up two families living on an adjoining property,” Balram said. “A grey VW Tiguan was taken by suspects.” Balram said the vehicle was later recovered in a joint operation by Rusa, Tracker, SAPS Verulam, Marshall Security and SBA Security. The vehicle was recovered in Shukuma Place, Inanda, south-west of Verulam. Balram added a third home was robbed by the same suspects 12 minutes earlier, in Dawncrest. Daily News
