Durban - Police arrested two suspects in uMhlanga on Friday after trying to sell a vehicle that was allegedly stolen in Gauteng. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said that on Friday the Provincial Special Investigations and Tracking Task Team followed up on intelligence about a stolen vehicle.  “It is alleged that the vehicle was meant to be sold in uMhlanga. Police proceeded to the location for observation with the assistance of other role-players.” Ngcobo added that two men who were planning to sell the vehicle were spotted waiting for the buyer.  “The police officers approached the men and enquired about the vehicle. They failed to provide the police with a response. The suspects aged between 22 and 24 were arrested for theft after being found in possession of the stolen vehicle. They were both detained at Durban North SAPS.” Ngcobo said that a preliminary investigation revealed that the vehicle was sought on a Wierdabrug case in Centurion, Gauteng.  “It was revealed that the vehicle was registered in the name of a person who died in 2020 but it was only registered in May 2022. An additional count of fraud was added to the charges against the suspects.” Ngcobo added that the 22-year-old suspect was linked to two cases of business robbery and theft opened in Gauteng.  “He will be handed over to Gauteng police for further profiling. His accomplice will appear before the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday.” THE MERCURY
