Durban — Police are investigating a case of malicious damage to property after an eThekwini Municipality ward councillor’s office was robbed and torched. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo confirmed that a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Mariannhill police station after an office in Klaarwater was allegedly damaged by unknown people on June 20 at 6.15pm. “The suspects stole a microwave, tissue, soap, keys and computer and fled the scene,” Ngcobo said. After numerous attempts, councillor Sibusiso Khwela could not be reached for comment by the time of publication. Mohamed Bilal Khan of Chatsworth Crime Watch said they received reports that Khwela’s office in Klaarwater at 2 Ndwandwe Street was vandalised and the guard room burnt. “The windows were broken and the suspects gained access into the boardroom and stole items that included a microwave, laptop, garden tools and a wheelbarrow,” Khan said. He said Khwela believed residents in Klaarwater were responsible. “They were protesting because of no electricity earlier in the day by burning tyres and he told them that teams were on the ground repairing the fault to restore electricity and it was resolved before 8pm on Monday ... However, he believes that they still went ahead and vandalised the office and he can’t understand why,” Khan said. Daily News
