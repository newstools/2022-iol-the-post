Durban — A private security company rescued a truck driver who was found bound inside an abandoned hijacked fuel tanker in Isipingo. PT Alarms spokesperson Dhevan Govindasamy said: “It was PT Alarms units to the rescue after a trucker was allegedly hijacked and found assaulted and bound inside his vehicle in the early hours of this morning, along the old Airport Road, in Isipingo.” Govindasamy said that according to PT units, at around 3.25am, a taxi driver alerted the PT Tactical Unit, PT Armed Response and PT Ambulance members of a possible truck driver in distress on the Old Airport Road. He said that PT members followed the taxi driver to the location and found a fuel tanker on the side of the road. On further inspection and upon calling out for the driver, he responded from inside the truck that he was tied up and had been hijacked. “The truck driver was found bound with cable ties. The driver of the fuel tanker alleged that he was hijacked at the M7/N2 intersection by three armed suspects, believed to be foreigners, in a white BMW. “The driver further stated he was kicked on the leg and on his back. He alleged that the suspects drove the truck to an unknown location, emptied the tanker and then left the truck on the old Airport Road in the Isipingo policing area,” Govindasamy said. Govindasamy said Isipingo SAPS was informed of the incident via the PT Alarms control room and they arrived promptly on the scene. He said PT ambulance paramedics assessed the driver. Govindasamy added that the truck driver with the fuel tanker were then escorted to Bellair SAPS for further processing. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
