Durban - Police are investigating a case of murder after a teenage boy was found dead with multiple wounds on the body in Inanda, north of Durban, on Sunday morning. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said the case was opened at Inanda SAPS after an 18-year-old was found dead in the Nkangala area in Inanda. “The victim had multiple wounds on the body. The motive for the killing is unknown,” Ngcobo said. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) responded to the scene after the body was found by the boy, Sanele Mncwabe’s, family at 9.27am while searching for him. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said Mncwabe was accused of stealing a cellphone. His body was discovered on an unpaved pathway. “On arrival, Rusa Medics examined the teenager and discovered that he had sustained blunt force trauma to his body,” Balram said. “According to his family, three of the deceased’s friends arrived at their residence in eMzinyathi, KZN this morning (Sunday) at approximately 9am and queried if Mncwabe returned last night (Saturday). They informed his family that they were assaulted by members of the community after they were accused of stealing a cellphone. The three managed to escape. However, they were unable to locate Mncwabe thereafter. The boy’s family launched a search party and recovered his bruised and battered body in Nkangala, KZN.” Balram said the boy was a Grade 10 pupil at Magqibagqiba Secondary School in eMzinyathi, KZN.
