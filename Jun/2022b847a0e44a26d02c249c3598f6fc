Durban — A man was left with a possible spinal injury after a metal cage fell on him at a construction site in Ballito, north of Durban. On Tuesday, IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said the emergency service responded to a construction site in Ballito where it was reported that a metal cage had fallen on a person. “Upon the arrival of IPSS Medical Rescue advanced life support paramedics, it was found that a man had sustained a possible spinal injury,” Meyrick said. “The man was stabilised and transported to a nearby facility for further treatment by IPSS Medical Rescue advanced life support paramedics.” Attempts to reach IPSS Medical Rescue for an update on the man were unsuccessful. Over the past few months, various emergency services have responded to reports of injuries and deaths at construction sites across KwaZulu-Natal. In April, Medi Response responded to the Ballito area after it was reported that a trench had collapsed, entrapping two persons within. The injured were removed from the compromised site by their colleagues before emergency services arrived. “A worker sustained critical injuries and was airlifted to hospital with the assistance of Air Wing Services. The second worker was transported by Medi Response ambulance to a nearby facility,” said spokesperson Paul Herbst. In February, a man in his forties was killed at a construction site in the Musgrave area. ALS Paramedics Medical Services and the eThekwini Fire Department arrived on the scene to find construction workers frantically digging to try and rescue the man. “The eThekwini Fire Department together with ALS Paramedics quickly took over from the workers and managed to free most of his body. ALS Paramedics assessed the man and, unfortunately, found that he had sustained fatal injuries. There was nothing more paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene,” said spokesperson Garrith Jamieson. Daily News
