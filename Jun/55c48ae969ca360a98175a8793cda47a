Durban: A man believed to be in his 30s was found dead in a passenger seat of an e-hailing car on Friday morning in Amanzimtoti, south of Durban. According to Kyle van Reenen from Emer-G-Med paramedics, they responded just after 7am.  The incident took place in Tacoma Road in Amanzimtoti.  “We responded after a vehicle was noted to be obstructing the roadway with an unresponsive passenger seated in the front. “On closer inspection, the vehicle was noted to have bullet holes, and the occupant, a male approximately thirty years of age, was found to have sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics.” Van Reenan said the motive behind the shooting was unknown.  KZN police said the complainant that in the early hours of Friday morning he and his colleagues were conducting patrols duties on R102 Near Crocworld, Clansthal when they noticed an unknown grey vehicle with three men busy loading overhead copper cables.  “The suspects spotted the security guards, dropped cables and opened fire while fleeing the scene,” said spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo.  “The security guards retaliated while chasing the suspects who drove away in unknown direction. Charges of attempted  murder, tampering with essential infrastructure and theft were opened at Umkomaas police station for investigation.” Ngcobo said the same vehicle was found abandoned this morning on Tacoma Road in Amanzimtoti.  “Police found the body of a 25-year-old man seated in the passenger seat with a gunshot wound at the back. The vehicle was searched and overhead copper cables was recovered. It is alleged that the vehicle was dumped by the suspects who fled the scene on foot when they noticed that their friend has succumbed to his injuries. An inquest docket was opened at Amanzimtoti police station for investigation.” IOL
