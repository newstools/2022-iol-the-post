Durban – The eThekwini Municipality is warning residents against engaging in dangerous behaviour on its buses. It said it was concerned about individuals riding on the bumpers of moving buses and people throwing stones at buses, causing damage. “The city’s Transport Authority warns communities against throwing stones at buses and the life-threatening consequences of riding on the rear bumper of a moving bus. “Durban Transport has been faced with this dangerous behaviour conducted by young adults including school children,” the city said on Thursday. The city said on most afternoons, the stoning and bumper riding of buses had become the norm, especially in uMlazi and Ntuzuma. In the past six months, about 82 buses had windows damaged caused by stone throwing which resulted in unnecessary costs for the municipality and affected bus availability. “The damage of municipal property is a criminal offence and may lead to prosecution.” The city added the youth should be discouraged from riding on the back of moving buses, as it posed a danger to them and other motorists and could prove fatal. The city said parents and the public should assist to stop this dangerous behaviour. The city said the public could report any incidents they witnessed to the police or to the uMlazi Depot on 031 906 2651, the Ntuzuma Depot on 031 504 3421, or eThekwini Transport Authority on 082 268 4185.
