Durban: Shaun Naicker, accused of burning his girlfriend to death, will remain behind bars after his application for bail was denied in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Naicker, 39, an employee at a shipping company, is accused of killing Jackie Naidoo on May 9. Naidoo, 35, died in a fire at her flat in Westham, Phoenix. She was burnt beyond recognition. She lived in a two-bedroom council flat with her 12-year-old son and Naicker. They had been in a relationship for four years. Colleen Vermeulen, her sister, said according to neighbours, on the morning of the incident they saw her nephew leave for school and Naicker packing his belongings and leaving the home in his girlfriend’s car. "Moments later, her neighbours heard glass exploding and then saw the fire. They called the fire department and police for help. My sister was found on her bed. Her African Grey birds also died." Thulani Ndonyela, the investigating officer, opposed bail based on the seriousness of the charge against Naicker, the community being angry at him, and Naidoo’s family being fearful of him.  He handed a petition containing over 800 signatures from the community opposing Naicker's bail. The matter was adjourned to next month. The Post
