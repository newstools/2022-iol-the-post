Durban – The University of KwaZulu-Natal says university management is aware of the ongoing protests at some of its campuses. The student protests are over the suspension of some workers including guards and cleaning staff. UKZN said destruction of property (two tractors and a container) was reported at its Edgewood campus in the early hours of Tuesday.  Protests and destruction of property were reported at the Westville campus this morning. The university said despite the protests, there were no disruptions to its online teaching and learning programme. “The situation at both campuses is calm. RMS, supported by members of the SAPS and university-appointed private security, are monitoring the situation at all campuses to ensure the safety of all staff, students and property. “University management condemns any criminal conduct, which includes the damage to property and threats to staff and students. The university continues to engage with students through recognised structures that can deal with their grievances.” Students from the Westville campus started protests yesterday demanding the reinstatement of the suspended staff. UKZN student Thami Khuzwayo says university management decided to suspend about 200 staff members (cleaners, gardeners and security personnel) across its campuses.  “So there have been protests ever since, not just in Westville but in all campuses. We don't have cleaners anymore and it’s bad.” SRC chairperson of the Edgewood campus Sizwe Gina said although this was a staff-related issue, it was affecting the students directly. “Without security guards we feel unsafe and our campuses are dirty and unsanitary,” he said. Gina says the university promised to bring a contracted cleaning company to the Edgewood campus to clean it while the cleaners are suspended for 30 days. “If the cleaners don’t come today we will definitely protest,” he said.
