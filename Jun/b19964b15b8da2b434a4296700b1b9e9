Durban – A routine cleaning in northern Durban led to the discovery of an old rusted firearm. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said that with the popular Netflix series Stranger Things releasing its latest season, they knew something strange was bound to happen. “Yesterday (Tuesday) a local gardening service found a very old rusted firearm while doing a routine clean in Sunningdale Park,” Powell said on Wednesday. “A resident from the area had posted to the local crime group that the gardening services, Clean Green, had found a firearm by the park on the corner of Fernlea Road and Round The Green Street.” Powell said that one of their special ops team members attended the scene and reported that while a staff member was busy raking, she found the rusted revolver. He said the firearm was collected by a Sergeant Daniels and a Constable Pillay from the Durban North SAPS. “Stranger Things have happened at Marshall!” Powell said. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said it was alleged that on the morning of June 8, 2022, gardeners were cleaning a yard at a private property when they discovered an old firearm. “The property owner called the police and an inquiry was opened at Durban North police station for investigation,” Ngcobo said.
