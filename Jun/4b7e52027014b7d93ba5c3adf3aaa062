Durban – The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) has stated that although gannet and dolphin activity may have been sardine related during their recent observation flight to the Eastern Cape, no actual sardine shoals were seen due to poor water visibility. The KZNSB had conducted an observation flight on Tuesday to assess the movement of the sardine shoals thus far. The flight had departed from Virginia airport and turned at East London. KZNSB acting head of operations Greg Thompson said the water was discoloured, from Virginia right through to East London, with patches of 2-metre visibility occasionally. These conditions were probably due to the large swell over the weekend, which contributed to silt being churned up off the sea bed. “However there were good numbers of common dolphins, with Terns feeding on the clean water line offshore, between Grosvenor and Mboyti in the Eastern Cape,” Thompson said. “The gannet and dolphin activity then increased again in the Coffee Bay to Wavecrest area and once again off the Kei River mouth.” Thompson said that the large concentrations of gannets seen a month ago seem to have disappeared for now. “Although some of the activity may have been sardine related, no actual sardine shoals were seen on this flight due to the poor water visibility. Patches of fish oil were seen regularly but all further offshore.” “Hopefully the activity will improve once the sea settles and the visibility improves,” Thompson said. He said that the next flight to East London was scheduled for June 14, 2022, but it was dependent on weather conditions. Daily News
