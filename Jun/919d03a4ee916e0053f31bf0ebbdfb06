Durban — The body of a girl was discovered in bushes in the Pietermaritzburg area on Youth Day. Mi7 National Group spokesperson Colin David said that just after 1pm on Youth Day, Mi7 National Group's Emergency Medical Services was dispatched after reports that a young girl was found in the bushes near Ohrtmann Road in the Willowton area. David said that Mi7 medics found the police already on the scene and were taken to the body, which was found by community members passing through. “On assessment, the girl, believed to be about 15 years old, was declared dead by Mi7 medics,” David said. He said police were carrying out further investigations. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said: “A body of a girl was found at the corner of Du Toit Viljoen Road and Ohrtmann Road and an inquest docket was opened at Mountain Rise SAPS.” Reacting to the news on Facebook, Devika Suresh said it was really sad. Her friend’s sister was also murdered about a month ago and she was found in the bushes, almost in the same place. Siyabonga Ndlovu asked whether the girl’s family had been identified because there was a teenage girl who had been missing for two weeks, therefore, the girl who was found dead might be her. Menelisi Menzinto Ndimande questioned what was happening in Pietermaritzburg. Ngcobo said there was no respect for life in the city. “Hope they find out what happened to her. We'd like to know also.” Daily News
