Durban — The KZN Marine Stranding Network has expressed its excitement to news that Tweni, the subantarctic fur seal that was stranded on the South Coast, would be released as soon as he reaches his goal weight. The network was reacting to news by the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) that Tweni appeared to be on the road to recovery. “Great news from Saambr Sea World regarding Tweni! Cannot wait for him to be released!” the network said. Saambr’s Ann Kunz said when they last reported about Tweni, on May 28, he had just arrived at uShaka Sea World. “He is now feeding well on an assortment of sardine, squid and hake which the staff offer to him at intervals throughout the day,” Kunz said. She said Tweni spends most of his day lying around the side of the pool interspersed with long energetic periods in the water frolicking and grooming. Although he is underweight, his X-rays and blood showed no areas of concern. The injury to his eye was confirmed as an old injury which required no treatment. “We are currently working out his target weight and once that is set, we will work towards helping him achieve his target weight. “We have no way of knowing precisely how long it will take for him to reach his goal weight as it depends on many variables. As soon as he is close to his target we will start working on plans for his release,” Kunz said. Kunz said that until then, Tweni would probably continue to laze around the side of the pool watching the curious humans as they go about their duties trying to meet his every need. Daily News
