Durban - KwaZulu-Natal will continue to experience cold weather tomorrow and throughout the weekend with another cold front expected to hit the province on Sunday, the South African Weather Service said on Thursday. Forecaster from the Durban office, Wiseman Dlamini said the cold weather that has seen locals going for warmer clothes this week was a result of two cold fronts coming from the western part of the country, which had resulted in heavy rains in the Western Cape. Thursday got off to a chilly start in some parts of the province, with low morning temperatures in Underberg, Mooi River, Kokstad and Ladysmith.  Clear skies have been forecast for tomorrow and Saturday with temperatures expected to peak at the high teens to mid twenties.  Durban is expected to reach a high of 20°C tomorrow, with Pietermaritzburg at 19°C and Richards Bay at 21°C.  “We expect clear skies during the weekend, however, temperatures will remain low in many parts of the province and there is a 30% chance of showers,” said Dlamini. According to the weather forecaster, the cold weather and low temperatures are consistent with the winter season. THE MERCURY
