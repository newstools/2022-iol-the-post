Durban - On June 28 the three men out on bail in the murder of 74-year-old motorbike enthusiast Kenneth William Price will join another in the dock for the possession of suspected stolen property. Julio Nobrega, 32,  who is Price’s neighbour, Nathan Padayachee, 23, Nobrega’s employee, and Nikiel Pillay, 24, who also works for Nobrega, will join Metale Pillay,18, in court. Price was reported missing on December 6 when his family raised the alarm after failing to get hold of him. He lived alone in Oliver Leese Road in Malvern. Police investigations led to the recovery of his decomposing body in Richards Bay last month. Metale Pillay had been granted R2 000 bail in this matter on May 20. Nobrega and the other two were released on a warning for the alleged crime. They were granted R5 000 bail in the murder case by the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. The State alleges that the four are guilty of possession of property stolen from Price. In December 2021 the accused were found in possession of suspected stolen goods, namely three motorbikes, a bicycle, DVD player and an angle grinder. Magistrate Gwendolyn Robinson said that having heard the submissions of the men’s personal circumstances the court was satisfied that it was in the interest of justice to release them on warning. She went on to warn the accused not to interfere with the fourth accused (Metale Pillay). Daily News
