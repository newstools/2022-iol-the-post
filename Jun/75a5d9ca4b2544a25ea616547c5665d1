Durban – Wessa uMngeni Valley Nature Reserve says there is no need to panic, the hippo is on the loose but not in the community. Earlier this week, the nature reserve had issued a notice that there was a hippo around the uMngeni Valley in a vlei between the Indulo campsite and Sunset Rock. “Please be extra careful when walking around the reserve. We advise you to please report to the reception before going to the reserve,” the reserve said in a Facebook post on Monday. On Wednesday, speaking to the Daily News, general manager Sfundo Sibiya said the hippo never left the reserve, “it was moving across two reserves”, uMngeni Valley and Karkloof Nature Reserve. Sibiya said the warning was for people walking within the reserve. “We noticed that the hippo was moving around the two reserves because we saw the hippo’s prints,” Sibiya said. He said that it was a fully grown hippo from the Karkloof Nature Reserve. Upon hearing of the hippo, some people were excited. Dejaaysips Sips said it was very interesting. Mish van Staden said: “Oh my gosh, how exciting! If the fence between uMngeni and Karkloof spa is not good then there's (the) possibility of walking into buffalo and rhinos as well! Be on your guard, people!” Michelle Gregg said it was exciting while Richard Kelly commented “fun times”. Earlier this month, the uMngeni Valley Nature Reserve rescued a blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) that escaped from the reserve. The animal was successfully sedated, treated and safely delivered back to the reserve with the help of Wildlife Solutions and FreeMe. Wessa uMngeni Valley Nature Reserve is 1km from Howick at the base of the Howick Falls. It is a 950 hectare outdoor classroom and was declared a protected reserve in 2019. Daily News
