Durban -  A Suzuki vehicle was recovered in nine minutes in KwaMashu, by Marshall Security and Netstar Tracking, after being hijacked from the Newlands Area on Thursday.  Last Tuesday, Marshall Security recovered a Silver VW Tiguan in Shukuma Place, Inanda, within 15 minutes after being  taken in an armed home invasion in Verulam. Tyron Powell, the Marshall Security managing director, said that on Thursday, Marshall Security’s special operations team assisted Netstar Tracking with locating a hijacked Suzuki in the Kwamashu area.  “On Thursday evening, at approximately 6.50pm, members of our special ops team were activated to assist Netstar Tracking with a hijacked white Suzuki Dzire in the Newlands area. Members of our team immediately responded and within nine minutes of being activated, the vehicle was recovered abandoned and severely stripped near a local tavern in KwaMashu K-Section.” Powell said the scene was secured and handed over to the KwaMashu SAPS for further investigation and processing. In a separate incident, our sister newspaper, the Daily News, reported that last Tuesday,  a silver VW Tiguan, stolen during an armed home invasion in Verulam, north of Durban was recovered within 15 minutes in  Shukuma Place, Inanda.
