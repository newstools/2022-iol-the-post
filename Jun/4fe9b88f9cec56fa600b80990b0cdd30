DURBAN -The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal has called on gun owners to make their homes and communities safer by storing their weapons securely, in order to prevent gun violence in schools. This comes after a Grade 10 pupil was allegedly shot by another pupil at a school in Sea View, Durban, last week. IFP KZN Provincial Spokesperson for Education, Thembeni Madlopha-Mthethwa says irresponsible gun owners must take responsibility when their weapons are used by their children.  “Gun owners must ensure that their guns in their homes are locked away and unloaded, with the ammunition stored securely in a separate location. Parents must be held accountable for the safety of their firearms, as well as their children,” said Madlopha-Mthethwa. The IFP further questioned how the firearm had entered the school undetected. “This incident again raises serious questions about the lack of safety at schools. We have raised our concerns about this issue many times in the past but our calls have fallen on deaf ears. The MEC of Education, Kwazi Mshengu, must take at least part of the blame, as he has failed to increase security in our schools,” said Madlopha-Mthethwa. She said pupils and teachers need to be safe in their schools.  “Parents and families trust schools to keep their children safe. Unfortunately, right now, they are not safe. The KZN Department of Education must stop violence in our schools. It must prioritise the safety of teachers and learners. Schools must not be turned into battlefields; they are places of learning,” Madlopha-Mthethwa said. The IFP further called for metal detectors, CCTV cameras and security personnel to be available at all schools, to ensure the safety of school communities, and to deter students and visitors from bringing weapons to schools.
