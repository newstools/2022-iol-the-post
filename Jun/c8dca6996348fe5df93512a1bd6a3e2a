Durban - A delegation led by Minister of Water and Sanitation Senzo Mchunu and KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala will visit Ugu District Municipality on Friday to address the concerns raised by the community over long-standing water issues. This comes after ongoing water supply issues in the district which has led to anger and frustration by affected residents. Ugu District Municipality comprises four local municipalities including Ray Nkonyeni Local Municipality, Umuziwabantu Local Municipality, Umdoni Local Municipality and Umzumbe Local Municipality. A statement by the Department of Water and Sanitation said the minister and premier, accompanied by officials from Ugu District Municipality will engage with members of the community at the Ugu Sports and Leisure Complex. “Minister Mchunu and Premier Zikalala will therefore engage with members of the community to enlighten them about the measures that will be implemented to restore uninterrupted supply to communities, and also the plans to restore damaged water infrastructure in the area,” said the statement. According to the department, the district has a population of more than 898 000 people. “In recent months, the municipality has been struggling to supply water in the district and this has led to residents protesting in the streets and destroying infrastructure. As a result, the municipality’s ability to provide constant water supply has been compromised,” it said. Last week, The Mercury reported that Ugu District Municipality which is supplied by different pump stations, experienced low to no water supply while refurbishments were taking place. The report said disgruntled residents have shared their annoyance with the ongoing water supply issues in the municipality. “But there is no water once again in Margate x3....every weekend we don’t have water really this isn't the way to treat your customers paying your salaries,” wrote a resident on Facebook.
