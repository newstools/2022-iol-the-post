Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa said: “From May 1 to May 31, 2022, FCS Unit detectives arrested 234 suspects for crimes such as rape, kidnapping, abduction, attempted murder, assault with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, child neglect and indecent exposure. “During this period, 26 convictions were secured. This included two life sentences and 395 years of imprisonment for the many suspects who appeared in the numerous courts within the province.” Ngcobo said as more cases were pending in court it was certain that many other suspects would be receiving sentences that will serve as a lesson to other criminals. Ngcobo said KZN FCS Unit detectives urged citizens to be the victims’ support system and report any suspicions of abuse to enable police to investigate and put abusers behind bars. Society should stop victim-blaming and encourage them to speak up, especially children who are sometimes frightened and helpless.
