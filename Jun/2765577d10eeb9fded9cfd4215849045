Durban - eThekwini Municipality has awarded a woman scholar driver a brand-new Toyota Quantum vehicle in the City’s Safe to School, Safe to Home Scholar Transport Awards ceremony at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Tuesday. The City partnered with Road Safety Partnership South Africa, Netstar, and Toyota South Africa Motors on the project. Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said Nondumiso Hlengwa drove off with a brand-new Toyota Quantum. Mayisela said Hlengwa was among eight finalists who recorded no transgressions over the monitoring period, despite them all driving more than 4 000 kilometres during that time. “The drivers were scored according to the number of transgressions the tracking devices detected during their drives to school and then during the trip home. The transgressions included speeding, harsh acceleration, and harsh braking,” he said. Hlengwa was selected through an electronic lucky draw. She said winning the Quantum will allow her to grow her business. “I will now be able to transport additional children. I was transporting learners with my Toyota Avanza and had to turn some children away who requested transport because there was no space, and I did not want to overload the vehicle. The safety of learners is always my priority,” she said. Mayisela further explained that the aim of the project is to contribute towards the reduction in the death and injury of pupils in road accidents while travelling to and from school. The project began in 2019 with the selection of drivers and training. He said approximately 150 drivers from the south and west regions were trained over the course of three years. “Drivers were rewarded with fuel vouchers in each period for the least transgressions per kilometre,” said Mayisela. Mayisela said the remaining seven finalists received a cheque of R10 000 each. THE MERCURY
