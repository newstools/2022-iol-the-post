Durban - Sukuma Comprehensive High School’s issues have caught the attention of KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu, who met with the Sukuma High School school governing body (SGB) and district management earlier this week to resolve several matters. On Monday, Mshengu met with the school’s SGB and district management led by district director Siqhamo Mabinza. The department said that the issues included human resources-related matters, national school nutrition programmes and general school governance issues. It said that after deliberations by the SGB and the district management, the MEC and the meeting agreed that the interviews for the principal post should be redone, due to issues that were raised with the interview process. “Following the decision of the grievance committee, the process of appointing the principal should be concluded within 21 days,” Mshengu said. He asked the SGB to be extremely thorough and vigilant when dealing with this matter. Mshengu further asked the SGB to deal with issues of norms and standards since there were issues in respect of financial management of the school, and; “We are going to ask our auditors to audit the financial matters of the schools and the issues related to norms and standards,” Mshengu said. “Sukuma is one of our schools with a rich pedagogical heritage and we are going to do everything in our  power to ensure that this institution returns to its glorious heritage.” Mshengu asked the community to be involved in issues of safety and governance at the school. The high school has produced many influential leaders both in government and in the corporate world. Daily News
