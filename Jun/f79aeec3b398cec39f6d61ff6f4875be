Durban – uShaka Sea World is making essential changes to one of its outside dolphin pools which has given a doctor a chance to expand her research on dolphin behaviour. uShaka Sea World said that visitors had noticed that it was currently making a few essential changes to one of the outside pools. It was pleased with the progress made as well as the quality of the workmanship and expect completion of the project in a couple of weeks. Dr Corrine Buhrmann, who is undertaking dolphin behaviour research at the SA Association for Marine Biological Research for the past two years, took the opportunity to expand her research to include monitoring of the dolphins’ well-being during construction. “She was assisted by two University of KwaZulu-Natal Master’s students who have been working with us on other projects focused on the variations in sound made by both fish and penguins,” said uShaka’s Ann Kunz. “We are looking forward to the day when we can refill this pool and thank everyone who has contributed to this project.” Daily News
