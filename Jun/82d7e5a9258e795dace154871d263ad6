Durban — The Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) has revealed that recent violent protests resulted in the destruction of property worth R2 million, and that 22 students have been arrested. In an update, acting vice-chancellor and principal Professor Marcus Ramogale said the unrest that had engulfed the university started on June 13, when a group of masked students disrupted first-semester examinations, demanding, among other things, the postponement of these examinations in order to have a study time of several days. Ramogale said it escalated on June 23 when a violent student protest erupted on the main campus. A group of about 30 students, some with their faces covered, started pelting security personnel at the main entrance with stones. The security personnel scattered. The protesting group was carrying several 5-litre containers of sanitiser, which they then used to torch university buildings and two vehicles. He said an investigation began as soon as the police and additional security arrived. “It has since been established that MUT and non-MUT students were involved. The external hand involved was in the form of hired students from sister universities in the province of KwaZulu-Natal,” Ramogale said. He said an assessment of damage to property was under way, and so far they had been able to establish the following: “So far, the total damage is estimated to be above R2 million,” Ramogale said.
