Durban - On his third and last black mamba call-out on Friday, Nick Evans said he rushed to KwaDabeka in Pinetown after staff members at a business premises saved a black mamba from being killed by a passer-by. Evans was accompanied by friend and colleague Dr Cormac Price. He said the staff members spotted a black mamba basking in the sun, next to a pile of pallets. “Apparently someone, a passer-by, wanted to kill it, but the other guys stopped him from doing so,” he said. Evans said one of the staff had known of him as he had gone to one of his awareness talks. He said the staff member managed to contact him for assistance. “The snake was not visible when we arrived, it had gone into the pallets. There were a lot of pallets! It looked like it would be a long job. “However, I walked to where it was seen going in, and there it was! Curled up, catching a bit of sun, but where people couldn’t see it. It was a quick, easy, uneventful catch,” said Evans. Evans said they allowed everyone to touch the mamba. He said everyone jumped at the opportunity. “I think the experience was amazing for them, and they’ll be further encouraged to save snakes in future,” he said. He added that he was grateful that these employees saved the mamba. “She has since been released in a human-free environment,” said Evans.
