Durban – A crash on the N3 south-bound carriageway in the vicinity of Hammarsdale resulted in the deaths of five people and a further five were injured on Sunday. Robert Mckenzie, from KZN Emergency Medical Services, said paramedics responded to the scene just after 6pm. He said the accident involved a light-delivery van which overturned. “Tragically five people sustained fatal injuries in this crash and paramedics from several private ambulance services including KZN Emergency Medical Services treated five patients at the scene for serious injuries before transporting them to several health institutions for continued medical care,” said Mckenzie. Traffic groups on social media reported lengthy delays along the route as the scene was attended to.   In another major accident on Sunday afternoon, Mckenzie said paramedics from KZN EMS responded to the Waterloo area in Verulam where a bus overturned. He said paramedics treated and stabilised 35 people at the scene before transporting them to hospitals for continued medical care. “The majority of patients sustained minor injuries,” said Mckenzie. Reaction Unit South Africa said the bus was travelling back from a funeral in Buffelsdraai, Verulam, when the accident occurred.    On Saturday, Kwazulu Private Ambulance Service spokesperson Craig Botha said paramedics responded to the N2 southbound at Esperanza for reports of a collision. Botha said when emergency services arrived they found that 13 vehicles had been involved in a collision. “Paramedics quickly assessed the scene and found that 19 patients had sustained injuries ranging from serious to minor,” he said. Botha said the patients were treated on scene before being transported to a hospital for further treatment.   THE MERCURY
