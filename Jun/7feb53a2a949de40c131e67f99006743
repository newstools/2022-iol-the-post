Durban - eThekwini Municipality announced on Monday night that the city’s electricity prepaid tokens system was back online. This follows an announcement just before 8am on Monday that the system was down due to a break in the fibre lines. In the update, the City said primary and secondary links that manage electricity prepayment tokens are back online. “Residents can now purchase prepayment electricity tokens via third party vendors. Thank you for your patience,” said the municipality. Commenting on the update, one resident said the system going offline taught her a lesson to always have a spare token. Another resident asked if tokens expire. “Tokens don't expire unless your meter gets changed, you cannot use it for a different meter,” said the municipality in response. Another resident said: “Although we had no choice but to wait, there was definitely no patience. Thank you for informing us and for this repair being done within a day.” Meanwhile on Monday afternoon, the City also announced that there was a fibre break between Springfield and Westville which resulted in the disruption of services. These include eServices, eProcurement, Website, ESS disaster management, eSponder disaster management, Environmental City health. “Our technicians are working around the clock to resolve the matter. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause,” said the municipality. THE MERCURY
