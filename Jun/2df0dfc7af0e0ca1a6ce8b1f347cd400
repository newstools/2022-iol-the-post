Durban — An ex-boyfriend appeared in a KwaZulu-Natal on two counts of attempted murder for allegedly stabbing his ex-girlfriend and her sister over the weekend. Mncedisi Chili Zondi, 26, appeared in Maphumulo Magistrate’s Court on Monday on two counts of attempted murder and was remanded in custody until June 22, 2022, for a bail application. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said that in the early hours of Saturday morning, Zondi allegedly went to his girlfriend’s homestead in the Drayini area in Nsuze and knocked at the room that was occupied by her and her 23-year-old sister. The ex-girlfriend opened the door. “The suspect withdrew a sharp instrument and stabbed the victim in the chest. The suspect sat on top of her and continued stabbing the helpless victim. The victim’s sister came to her assistance and pushed him away from the victim. The suspect stood up and stabbed her before he fled the scene,” Ngcobo said. “Both victims sustained serious injuries and were transported to the hospital for medical attention.” Ngcobo said that Nsuze police were called and charges of attempted murder were opened for investigation. “The police worked tirelessly in tracing the suspect who went into hiding. The investigation led to the Gobinsimbi area where he was arrested and charged,” Ngcobo said. Daily News
