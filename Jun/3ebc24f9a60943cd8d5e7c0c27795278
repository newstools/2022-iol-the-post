Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal driver has come under fire on social media after he took a video while another driver tried to crawl out of his crashed vehicle, refusing to help the man because he was allegedly drunk. In the 22-second clip, the driver is seen with his head and upper body outside the driver’s window of his vehicle which is lying on its roof. While the driver is trying to crawl out of the wrecked car the person filming the video is heard saying in isiZulu: “Jah, do you all see this person. I’ve been driving with him since Richards Bay and along the way he has been driving badly, causing me to also drive badly. He’s driving a new Fortuner which has speed and power – he is drunk.” As the driver manages to slowly crawl out of the window of his car, the man who is filming him with a cellphone from inside his car continues speaking: “There he is, you can all see him getting out. I’m not even going to go and pull him out, this person nearly caused me to topple the truck.” With most of his upper body now out and able to balance on one elbow, a third person enters the frame of the video, running to the driver who reaches out his hand. “He must see how he gets out of there by himself f***. I won’t pull him out, I don’t have that time,” says the videographer as the third man tries to pull the driver out. Reacting to the video, Bulelwa Nomtha Tz, wrote: “Why don’t you help him and why are you returning one bad deed with another, are you now God?” Mayibongwe Goodenough Ntshangase commented that even if the man had caused the truck driver to drive badly, he should have helped him. “Is it still human to have the courage to talk like this about him (the crashed driver) let alone take a video while he is between life and death, this says a lot about you. Don’t do this again brother, it's not good. Ubuntu!!” Daily News
