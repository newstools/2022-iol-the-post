Durban – The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) says it has been alerted to a new scam in which potential students are offered enrolment at the university in exchange for a payment. It says scam artists posing as UKZN employees have been duping applicants to deposit cash into bank accounts that don’t belong to the university. “Anyone with information is urged to report it to the police or the UKZN Tip-offs Anonymous toll-free line 0800 203 285 or email ukzn@tip-offs.com,” said UKZN. It advised that all credible information on admissions could be found on the university’s website www.ukzn.ac.za and on all official UKZN social media platforms. UKZN said university staff did not use Gmail accounts to conduct any official university business. “Any correspondent from a Meryl A Savage is not official UKZN correspondence and should be disregarded. A bank account by Mr Julius Kataramu is not an official UKZN bank account,” it said. THE MERCURY
