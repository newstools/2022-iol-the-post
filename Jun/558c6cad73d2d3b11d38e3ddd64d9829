Durban - The Pietermaritzburg High Court, sitting in Madadeni, has sentenced a 56-year-old woman to life imprisonment for the murder of her estranged husband in Utrecht near Newcastle. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson Natasha Kara, said Penelope Phumelele Zulu was sentenced last Wednesday for the murder of her husband Nkosinathi Sipho Zulu, in April 2016. Kara said the accused decided to kill her husband when they stopped living together “She enlisted the assistance of Khanyisani Biyela, promising to pay R80 000 in return. Biyela then got Mandlenkosi Shezi to help him.” She said on the day of the incident the two men fetched the victim from a petrol station, drove him to an isolated area and shot him. “He died at the scene with the cause of death being brain injury due to a penetrating gunshot wound in the head.” Kara said the men fled the scene but were arrested after police viewed video footage from the petrol station. She said in the footage, the victim was seen getting into Shezi’s vehicle. “At that stage, Shezi implicated the others.” According to Kara, Biyela was convicted in March 2021 and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment and Shezi died in 2021 while out on bail. Kara said during the court proceedings, Senior State Advocate Nkonzwenhle Mlotshwa led the testimony of the victim’s girlfriend, who implicated Zulu. The advocate also led evidence from the bank records showing that Zulu had paid Shezi R50 000 as part payment for killing her husband. “Mlotshwa also told the court that Zulu had taken more than 11 funeral policies for Nkosinathi, electing herself as the beneficiary.” She said in aggravation of sentence, Mlotshwa led the testimonies of the victim's aunt and uncle. “They described him as an exemplary person who took care of his family members.” Kara said: “The NPA welcomes this successful prosecution and we commend the sterling work done by the prosecution and investigation team.” THE MERCURY
