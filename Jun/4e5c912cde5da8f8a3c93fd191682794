Durban – Alert dogs, who were inside an Umgeni Park home, began barking after two burglars broke in, in the early hours of this morning (Tues), stopping the thieves in their tracks. CCTV footage of the incident was shared on Sun Cell Watch, which is a crime alert group providing information about criminal activities in various areas. “Around 4.30am this morning, these thieves tried smashing down the sliding door of this home in Umgeni Park. They fled when the dogs inside started barking. They were going to grab a bag that was empty,” said the crime alert group. In the video, at least two figures are seen breaking into the house through the glass sliding doors.  One of the burglars is seen reaching out and picking up a bag, then quickly drops it and flees as dogs are heard barking.

Fidelity ADT says when it comes to the safety of your family and property the best course of action is prevention rather than dealing with the aftermath of a break-in or robbery. Charnel Hattingh, the head of marketing and communications at Fidelity ADT, says the last thing you want is for your home to have curb appeal to criminals. “Homes become easy targets when someone can see exactly what’s on offer and that the family is lax about security or not home often. If there is no dog, security systems or lights on, it makes it even easier for burglars. Make it a goal to keep your home from being targeted,” she said.
