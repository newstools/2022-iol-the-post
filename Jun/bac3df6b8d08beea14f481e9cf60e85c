Durban - Since May 4, there have been seven venomous snakes captured at a business premises in Reservoir Hills. Local snake rescuer Nick Evans has removed six black mambas, two of which were found mating, from the property since last month. Evans on Monday said a venomous snake went to bask in the same area where most of the mambas had basked. He said when he received the call, he had assumed the snake was a black mamba. “The snake was suspected to be a black mamba, so I was excited. Would we get closer to getting 10 there? When I peered over the wall, I was rather disappointed to see a large Mozambique spitting cobra!” However, Evans said while he was disappointed,it is always “cool to see a big spitter like this one”. He said he does not see many cobras in winter and this one was an impressive beast. “I was also fascinated that it chose that spot, the mambas’ spot, to bask. Black mambas and Mozambique spitting cobras have been documented to reside together. Still, I thought this was interesting. Maybe the two female mambas were so pretty, even he was after them.” Evans reached down with his long tongs and lifted the cobra. The 1.4 metre male cobra weighed 1kg. “I think I need to have an office at that property!” he joked.    THE MERCURY
