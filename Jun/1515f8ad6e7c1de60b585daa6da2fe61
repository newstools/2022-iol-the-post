Durban - A Durban e-hailing driver was targeted by an unknown number of criminals who allegedly posed as “passengers”, then hijacked him at gunpoint in the Sea Cow Lake area on Wednesday. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said the emergency dispatch centre received reports of gunshots on Mysore Road via a local community crime group yesterday around 10.40pm. He said armed response officers were immediately dispatched to the scene. “On their arrival, our members were informed that an e-hailing driver’s services had been requested to collect passengers at that location, but when he arrived it turned out to be a set-up, and he was held up at gunpoint by an unknown number of suspects,” said Powell. Powell said it was reported that the suspects assaulted him with a firearm on his head and fired shots in the air. They then hijacked his vehicle and fled the scene, he said. “A resident from the area informed our responding officers that the hijackers had headed into a nearby informal settlement in the stolen vehicle,” said Powell. Powell said Marshall Security, together with the Durban Flying Squad, who quickly arrived on scene, made their way into the informal settlement to look for the vehicle. He said they found the vehicle, which had been stripped and abandoned by the robbers. “The scene was handed over to the SAPS for further investigation and processing,” said Powell. THE MERCURY
