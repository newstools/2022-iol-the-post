Durban - The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal will launch a Social Cohesion programme via a Sports, Arts and a Cultural Festival to foster unity and social cohesion, especially among African and Indian communities in Phoenix. MEC for Education Kwazi Mshengu says the incidents that took place in Phoenix in July last year during civil unrest and looting caused the department to reflect deeply and they felt that programmes and activities around social cohesion must be intensified.  “We are launching this programme during Youth Month because we realise that if we are to realise social cohesion, young people must be at the centre of every programme in this regard.” The social cohesion events will take place tomorrow and they will start at Ohlange High School in Inanda and continue at Bethsaida International Ministries in Phoenix. They will be presided over by the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal Sihle Zikalala, MEC for Education Kwazi Mshengu and other members of the executive. “On the day of the event, learners are going to participate in various sporting activities, cultural activities as well as oral debates on various topics relating to social cohesion,” said the department. There will also be a gala dinner with cultural activities. Zikalala will deliver the keynote address. THE MERCURY
