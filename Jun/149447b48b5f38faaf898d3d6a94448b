Durban - A suspect charged with the murders of a mother and daughter was expected to appear in Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said the 38-year-old suspect appeared at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday for murder, robbery and theft of a motor vehicle and he was remanded in custody until he appeared again on Monday. “It is alleged that on May 26, 2022, at 7.45pm, the bodies of a 75-year-old woman and her 58-year-old daughter were found at their house at Oribi Village in Pietermaritzburg. They were allegedly stabbed with a sharp instrument at the back of their heads. Nothing was taken inside the house except the vehicle that was stolen. The vehicle was recovered in eManzimtoti the following day,” said Ngcobo. She said the suspect was apprehended on Tuesday after an officer identified him as a wanted suspect following suspicious behaviour. “A police officer was in the Bluff area when he noticed a man wearing a hoodie covering his head and wearing a mask. When he saw the police officer he dropped his head and walked into the shop. The officer became suspicious and alerted his colleague about his suspicions. He then followed the man inside the shop while his colleague stood guard at the entrance of the shop.” Ngcobo said the officer approached the man who was now at the till and noticed that he was trying to avoid eye contact with him. “The police identified the man as a wanted suspect for a double murder that was circulated recently. The suspect was arrested and detained at Brighton Beach SAPS. He was charged with two counts of murder, robbery and theft of a motor vehicle,” she said. Daily News
