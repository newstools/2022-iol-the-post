Durban - Four armed criminals robbed a homeowner and his friends on Wednesday then shot a patrolling security officer while fleeing the scene in Newlands West, Durban. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the complainant was outside with his friends when they noticed four armed men jumping over the wall at 7.30pm. Gwala said the suspects assaulted the complainant with a firearm on his face then forced him and his friends inside the house. “They locked them (the victims) inside the room while ransacking the house,” she said. Gwala said the suspects stole laptops, cash, jewellery and cell phones, then drove away in their getaway vehicle. “It is alleged that while fleeing the scene the suspects came across a security guard who was driving past the house. They opened fire, wounding him in the abdomen and was taken to hospital for medical attention,” she said. ALS Paramedics Medical Services together with VIP Medical Response were dispatched to the scene. ALS spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said when paramedics arrived on the scene, they found that a reaction officer had sustained a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Jamieson said the officer was stabilised on the scene before being rushed through to a nearby Durban hospital for further treatment. “Two occupants from the house sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on the scene by Advanced Life Support Paramedics before being rushed through to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment that they required,” he said. Police said charges of attempted murder and robbery were opened at Newlands East police station for investigation. THE MERCURY
