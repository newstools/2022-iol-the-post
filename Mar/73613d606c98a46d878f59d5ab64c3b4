DURBAN - THE ANC’s national working committee (NWC) is said to have taken a decision to disband the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga provincial executive committees (PECs). The Daily News was informed by a source that attended the meeting when the issue was being discussed. According to the source, the PECs will be replaced by task teams which will be loaded with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s supporters. The source said this was being done to prevent the direction in which leaders in the two provinces were moving towards, as this was seen as being averse to Ramaphosa. In the Eastern Cape, the source said, this was specifically done to try and save Premier Oscar Mabuyane. ANC general manager Febe Potgieter said the party’s national spokesperson, Pule Mabe would communicate the decisions taken by the NWC meeting during the course of the week.  Mabuyane, who is also the ANC’s Eastern Cape provincial chairperson, declined to comment on what he termed “rumours.“ “It is the NWC’s competence to take that decision, and the NWC will communicate its decisions,” Mabuyane said. Attempts to get comments from the Mpumalanga PEC were unsuccessful. Provinces are preparing to hold their conferences and are expected to pronounce their choices of leaders to be elected during the party’s 55th elective conference expected to take place in December. So far it is expected that Ramaphosa will be challenged by former health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, and Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. Although the two have not publicly announced their campaigns, several media reports have revealed that their lobbyists were criss-crossing the country, speaking to branch and regional leaders.
