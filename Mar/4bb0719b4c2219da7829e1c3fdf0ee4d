DURBAN - The eThekwini Municipality has closed the Moses Mabhida People’s Park vaccination site due to low vaccination numbers and the expiration of their occupancy agreement. The municipality had issued a public notice stating that the Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Moses Mabhida People’s Park had closed on March 1, 2022. “The closure comes as the demand for vaccination declines and the stipulated occupancy agreement has expired,” the municipality said. The municipality said the public who received their initial dose at the Moses Mabhida vaccination site could go to their nearest clinic for subsequent doses, including booster dose. Earlier, IOL reported that according to the latest statistics only 36 percent of people in KZN have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. This is the lowest in South Africa, compared to the other nine provinces. The statistics in the past 24 hours shows that only 2.6million people out of 7.2 million have been inoculated. However 41 percent have received a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has for months complained about the decline in vaccination numbers. Last month, Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane and Department Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela took football legends to help promote Covid-19 vaccination in Sibongile township in Dundee, northern KZN. Then, Simelane said the biggest challenge they were confronting was the reluctance of people to get vaccinated. As they continued with their efforts to encourage their fellow compatriots to protect themselves against this virus through vaccination, they decided to team up with football legends. At the beginning of the vaccination drive, which started on May 17, 2021, in KZN, the province was vaccinating at least 100 000 people weekly. Premier Sihle Zikalala was also delighted with the number of Covid-19 vaccinations taking place in the province. Daily News
