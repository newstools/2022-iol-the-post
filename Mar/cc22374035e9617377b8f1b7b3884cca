DURBAN - The Department of Health has spent approximately R6 billion on vaccines to date. This was revealed by Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla in a parliamentary written question session by the EFF’s Floyd Shivambu. Shivambu had asked Phaahla the total amount the department had spent on the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines to date. He had also asked the total number of Covid-19 vaccines that were approved for usage in the country, and the names of those vaccines and what total number of vaccines had the government procured to date from each approved supplier and at what price. In addition, Phaahla had to explain the legal provisions the department relied on to enjoy the exclusive rights to procure vaccines from approved suppliers. Phaahla said: “The department has spent approximately R6 billion on vaccines to date.” He said four vaccines were approved for use in the country - Covid-19 vaccine Jannsen, Pfizer Comirnaty, Coronavac (Curanto Pharma); and BBIBP-CortV-Vaccine (Sinopharm) (MC Pharma). Phaahla said the government procured 31 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine Jannsen and 30 002 310 doses plus 1 392 300 doses through the COVAX Facility. “The pricing information cannot be shared as we are bound by non-disclosure agreements with manufacturers,” Phaahla said. He added: “There is no law that gives the government exclusive rights to procure vaccines from approved suppliers. However, with regards to Covid-19 vaccines, manufacturers opted to contract exclusively with government to make vaccines equitably available.” Shivambu’s response was received on February 25, 2022.
