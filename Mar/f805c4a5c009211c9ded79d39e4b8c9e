DURBAN – A python no longer than 1.5m slithered onto a farm and killed two chickens but did not eat them. That was according to snake catcher Nick Evans who rescued the snake from the farm last Friday. Evans said the python was in the place pythons usually were in when around human dwellings - a chicken coup. “They cannot resist a good chicken,” Evans said. “When I arrived, the python had crawled into an old motorbike tyre.  “It had killed two chickens throughout the night, but they were perhaps too big for it, as it didn’t eat any.  “I’ve not experienced that before, usually there’s just one, big, full python to be seen!” Evans said it was difficult to pull the tyre apart and grab the snake. He said it was suggested that he cut the tyre with a hacksaw, which he tried but it did not really work. Two staff members then offered to help him by pulling the tyre open for Evans while he extracted the snake.  After a bit of a struggle, they managed to get the snake out. “A small python, no more than 1.5m long.  “It looked like it really needed a good meal.  “I relocated it immediately after, in an area with an abundance of food,” Evans said. He said it was the third snake he had caught on the farm.  There were two black mambas. Evans added: “I am always grateful to the owners or staff for calling.  “I know they never used to.  “They used to take matters into their own hands before they started following me on Facebook.  “I’m glad they did, and that they told me that.  “It’s motivating and very encouraging.  “It just shows a little bit of awareness and education can go a long way. “I know it won’t be the last I see of them, there’s plenty of snakes there!” He also thanked the staff who helped him with the snake.
