DURBAN - A green mamba, believed to be the mate of the one that was locked in a cupboard before a snake catcher arrived, slithered into the same room “looking” for the female. KwaZulu-Natal South Coast snake catcher Sarel van der Merwe had rescued a female green mamba a week ago, only to be called out to the same property for a male green mamba. On Tuesday, Van der Merwe said: “Remember the female green mamba in Sea Park in a cupboard last week? Well, today, the male went through the window to go and look for his female... Will go and release him in the same area tomorrow (Wednesday) and hope they find each other again.” Van der Merwe also said one of the neighbours was peeping through the window to see the show. Last Monday morning, Van der Merwe had left his hospital bed, after recovering from a green mamba snake bite, to remove the first green mamba. He had received a call from a woman who spotted a green mamba in her cupboard. He told her to keep the door closed and when he is released from the hospital, he would go there. “We went there and I removed it from the cupboard.” Daily News
