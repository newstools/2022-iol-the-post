Durban – A teacher who has been charged with raping a 14-year-old pupil will be back in the Dundee Magistrate’s Court on Friday for his bail application.  Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “It is alleged that on February 18, 2022 at 10.30, the victim was at a school premises in Dundee when she was allegedly raped by a known suspect. The matter was reported to the Dundee police and the docket was transferred to the Dundee Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units for further investigation. The suspect was later arrested and charged.” Mbele added that the 36-year-old suspect, who cannot be named until he pleads, appeared again in court on Monday and was remanded in custody until Friday for the continuation of his bail application. Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza said the crime damaged the image of teachers.  “We have full confidence in our police and the Justice Department. This is one of the difficult cases to handle, but we have confidence that our justice system will ensure that the child gets justice.” She added that the department was pleased with the police’s swift response to the case. Kwazulu-Natal Department of Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said that the department had dealt with 18 similar cases since 2021.  “We want to send a clear and strong message that any educators found to be involved in such cases will be dealt with and removed. No form of abuse of learners will be tolerated; they will be removed and face the full might of the law.” Mthethwa added that the Department of Education had begun the process of removing educators who were found guilty of sexual misconduct charges.
