DURBAN - THE eThekwini Municipality’s employment equity profile has come under scrutiny after concerns were raised by the director- general (D-G) of the Department of Employment and Labour. The D-G found that some of the designated groups may not be adequately represented in the staff complement of the municipality. The designated group refers to individuals that should be prioritised when it comes to employment opportunities to address the imbalances of the past. This includes black people, women and people living with disabilities. The ANC has committed itself to ensuring that the metro’s employment profile reflects the make-up of society. A report tabled before council on Monday proposed that the Metro should do an analysis of its workforce profile.  The report asked for authority to be granted to the head of human capital to conduct an analysis of the workforce profile. It said issues or barriers to access identified during the process will be used to inform the content of the Employment Equity Plan. IFP councillor Jonathan Annipen said the findings by the D-G were concerning and were a severe indictment on the city. “It is concerning to note that the report makes particular mention of individuals with disabilities which shows prejudice towards these individuals as a minority group,” he said. ANC councillor Nkosenhle Madlala said a lot of work had been done in employing workers in line with the legislation especially as it related to employment equity to make sure that the demographics of those employed were in line with the population trends in general. “But we accept the findings by the D-G that there are areas where we are still falling short.”  Madlala said they would take bold steps to encourage people with disabilities to apply for jobs when opportunities become available. “The report by the D-G will go a long way in helping us to make sure that the workplace is reflective of the society we live in,” he said.
