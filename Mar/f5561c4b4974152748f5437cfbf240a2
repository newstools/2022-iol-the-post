DURBAN - Dundee farmer Garth Simpson, 68, was granted R10 000 bail in the Glencoe Magistrate’s Court after spending six months awaiting trial. Simpson is accused of killing Qiniso Dlamini, 17, who was allegedly collecting cattle belonging to his family and the community that had allegedly strayed onto Simpson’s farm in September last year. Simpson was granted bail on Monday, after AfriForum’s legal team assisted him in his appeal. Judge Poyo Dlwati ruled that there were inaccuracies in the decision to refuse Simpson bail. Simpson’s family was also concerned about his health. AfriForum was of the opinion that Simpson acted in self defence, and that he was refused bail due to political interference in the case. AfriForum previously announced that it would assist Simpson with legal assistance because it seemed that Simpson had a good defence, and that without proper legal assistance he could fall victim to racebased accusations and political interference. Jacques Broodryk, AfriForum’s campaigns manager, said as a rule it did not usually get involved in individual cases, but had made an exception because bigger issues were at stake that not only affected the accused, but also the broader community. “We are delighted Simpson has finally been granted bail; he is not a threat to anyone, has no previous convictions and acted in self defence. Courts need to make decisions on legal principles, and not politics. Loss of life is always tragic, but the way this case was handled was a travesty of justice, and needed to be rectified,” said Broodryk. Simpson was also charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm. Qiniso was shot in the abdomen and died at the scene. He was a Grade 10 pupil at Sebenzakusakhanya High School in Sithembile township, Glencoe. He had aspirations of becoming a lawyer. Daily News
