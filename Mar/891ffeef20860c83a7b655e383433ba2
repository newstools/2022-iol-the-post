DURBAN - Tourism KwaZulu-Natal wants to cement the province’s place among the leading destinations for business meetings and conferences at this year’s Meetings Africa 2022. Meetings Africa, which started on Monday and is being hosted in Johannesburg, aims to promote Africa as a sought-after business events destination. The event has returned after its absence in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of delegates from around the world will converge on the Sandton Convention Centre to find suitable destinations for their next big conference and meetings. Tourism KZN, which is responsible for the development, promotion and marketing of tourism, said that they would use Meetings Africa 2022 as a springboard to showcase to various exhibitors and buyers from across Africa and the world what the province’s business and leisure industry has to offer. General Manager of the Durban KwaZulu-Natal Convention Bureau, Sonto Mayise, said that the Meetings Africa 2022 trade show offers Tourism KZN the opportunity to demonstrate the provincial travel and tourism sector’s determination to recover. Mayise added that the Durban-KZN Convention Bureau would be hosting international buyers from Meetings Africa on the South Coast, North Coast, in the Drakensberg and in Durban after the exhibition so they can experience the province and see the conference facilities and venues that KZN has to offer. The KZN delegation includes representatives of several district municipalities so buyers and professional conference organisers are presented with a wider range of venues and provincial destinations to explore. Tourism KZN also said that through the Durban-KZN Convention Bureau, emerging entrepreneurs will get the opportunity to participate at Meetings Africa.  “This will afford them the opportunity to forge strategic relationships with international partners who can take their business to greater heights.” THE MERCURY
