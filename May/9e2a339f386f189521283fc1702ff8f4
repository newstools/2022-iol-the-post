DURBAN - Luck ran out for two suspects when the vehicle they were travelling in, which is wanted in connection with multiple motor vehicle theft cases in and around Durban, was spotted in Ballito on Tuesday. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said that at about 9.15am the Emergency Dispatch Centre was alerted via a Ballito crime alert group to a wanted vehicle spotted travelling in the area. Powell said the white Hyundai had been linked to various cases of theft of motor vehicles in the greater Durban area including in Ballito, uMhlanga and Durban North. He said the tactical team responded immediately along with the Umhlali SAPS and various other security companies. The vehicle was eventually brought to a stop at a well-known fast food restaurant off Moffat Drive, he said.   Powell said the two suspects inside the vehicle were immediately arrested. “Upon searching the vehicle, various car break-in implements including jamming devices were found, as well as various cloned number plates. The vehicle itself was also fitted with cloned number plates. “Various bank cards and retail account cards were found in the vehicle and are believed to have been stolen and used by the suspects,” he said. Powell said the two suspects were transported to Umhlali SAPS for further investigation and processing.
