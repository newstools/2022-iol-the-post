DURBAN - ActionSA has announced the appointment of Stephne Ashworth as the new PR councillor for Ward 22 in KwaDukuza Local Municipality. Ashworth received 1068 PR votes in ward 22 during the local government elections in 2021. ActionSA iLembe regional chairperson Nel Sewraj said Ashworth would be taking over from the former councillor Gerard de Billot. Sewraj said de Billot resigned due to business commitments that he felt made it difficult to perform his duties effectively.  Billot remains a member of ActionSA and will continue to participate and assist in the building of the organisation in KwaDukuza. Ashworth is relatively new to politics as she only joined ActionSA last year before the local government elections. She said she is excited to make a difference in the communities around her. “I believe we should all receive equal opportunities. When I moved to Ballito, I was shocked by the disparity in class and status. I want to work towards narrowing that,” said Ashworth. Ashworth was born in Zambia and was raised in Botswana, and has travelled to many parts of the world. Sewraj said Ashworth is dedicated, hard-working and selfless.  “She has extensive experience in community service, and this will be beneficial to the residents of KwaDukuza. ActionSA is confident that she will serve the organisation with distinction and play a vital role in fixing the broken municipality of KwaDukuza,” added Sewraj.
