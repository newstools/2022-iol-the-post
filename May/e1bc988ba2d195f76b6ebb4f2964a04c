Durban - Almost R280 million worth of jackpots from National Lottery games will expire if unclaimed.  In a statement, Ithuba urged players across the portfolio of the National Lottery games to check their tickets and to come forward to claim as soon as possible.  “As at 30 April 2022, there is an amount of R 279 451 903 in unclaimed jackpots across the portfolio of all our games, including the smaller prize winnings.  She added that all National Lottery tickets remain valid for a period of up to 365 days from the date of the draw. Ithuba said all winning tickets that are not validated within that period would automatically expire, and any unclaimed winnings from expired tickets are transferred to the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund for reallocation to good causes. “From time to time, a small portion of unclaimed and expired funds are used to support the popular Guaranteed Jackpot Programme,” said Mabuza.  These prizes are set to expire in 6 months:  Mabuza recommended that players write their name and ID number of the back of tickets at the time of purchase for ease of identification and ownership for bigger claims.
