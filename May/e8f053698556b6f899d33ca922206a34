Community crime activist and supporter of SAPS Berea, Nicky Burke,  has said as a community member, the Berea CAD 2022 is important because it brings together the various law enforcement agencies, who police the area, with the communities. She says this will allow residents to build a better understanding and relationship with the station commander and his team. “It gives us the community the opportunity to understand the workings of the police and to become members of the Berea CPF. It also gives us the community an opportunity to get together and work closer with the police to eradicate crime within our area,”said Burke. Burke has encouraged residents to attend the event with their families. The items the public can look forward to include:      MOST READ: – Anger over missing eThekwini Municipality workers, colleagues unhappy with city response as search continues – Suspects arrested after vehicle linked to several cases of car theft in Durban, Ballito, uMhlanga spotted – Family ‘shaken’ by home invasion in Reservoir Hills, brazen gang forced their way in at gunpoint – Pedestrian killed, 15 pupils injured in Pietermaritzburg crash – Public Alert: Alleged robbery suspect seen wearing an IPSS jacket stolen from an officer THE MERCURY
