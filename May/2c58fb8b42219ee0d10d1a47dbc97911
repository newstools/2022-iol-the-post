Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal family has been left distraught after the body of a woman was found stabbed and dumped. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder for investigation had been opened. “On May 29, 2022, at 6.30am, Empangeni police received a complaint of murder on Bhejane Street in the Empangeni area. On arrival, they found the body of a 24-year-old woman with stab wounds,” Gwala said. DA King Cetshwayo constituency chairperson Muzi Mtshali said the woman’s rape and murder could not go unpunished. He said the woman was found brutally raped and murdered in Nseleni outside Richards Bay. Mtshali said the victim was found naked and with her throat slit near the Nseleni library on Sunday morning. “While details remain sketchy at this stage, initial reports indicate that she may have been attacked where she was found,” Mtshali said. Speaking to the Daily News, Mtshali said they found and visited the woman’s family on Sunday. “The family was distraught because what happened was unexpected,” Mtshali said. “Her death was a huge shock to her family.” He said the woman was identified. Attempts to reach the family were unsuccessful. Earlier, Mtshali said Nseleni had, for many years, gained notoriety for its violent crime with little intervention from authorities. Recent SAPS oversights showed how the government had allowed the police force to degenerate almost beyond repair. This must change if innocent lives are to be saved. “Our communities cannot tolerate gender-based violence and rape. We can no longer watch our youth be brutalised and murdered on a daily basis. The DA will work with our national and provincial counterparts to ensure this latest horrendous incident does not just become a mere statistic. The perpetrators must be brought to book and removed from this community,” Mtshali said. Daily News
