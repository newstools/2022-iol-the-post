DURBAN - An eThekwini Municipality employee and two service providers have been arrested on fraud related charges, the city confirmed on Thursday. In a statement, the city said a clerk in the Water and Sanitation Unit is alleged to have colluded with service providers to short-circuit supply chain protocols to derive financial benefits. The city said mayor Mxolisi Kaunda welcomed the arrests. He reiterated that the city had declared fraud and corruption as its prime enemy.  The mayor also commended the city’s Integrity and Investigations Unit (CIIU) for its sterling work of ridding the municipality of acts of malfeasance. “This illicit behaviour deprives our residents of access to basic services. I am on record as saying that every cent of public money must go towards improving the well-being of our residents. It must not go to anyone’s pocket,” said Kaunda. He appealed to anyone who suspected criminal activity related to the city, to report it to the CIIU. Reports of fraud and corruption can be made through the following platforms: According to the city, the suspects were all released on bail and were facing charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering, contravention of various sections of the Municipal Finance Management Act and contravention of the Competition Act. “Let us now allow our institutions entrusted with dispensing justice to do their work,” said Kaunda.
