DURBAN: Crocworld Conservation Centre team was called to rescue a stiletto snake found in a pool at Freeland Park in Scottburgh on the South Coast.  Reptile curator at Crocworld Conservation Centre Wade Kilian said the caller who found the snake had said he initially wanted to pick it up to move it, but his wife had persuaded him to call the conservation centre. “These are a ground-dwelling species that usually come to the surface after rain, as the water saturates air pockets in the ground.  “I managed to rescue the snake and release it into a safe area the next day,” he said.  Killian explained that, due to their small size, stiletto snakes were often mistaken for a harmless species.  However, they were responsible for most of South Africa’s serious snake bites.  They have potent cytotoxic venom and, while not life-threatening, they’re responsible for many amputations.  The snake can be identified by two characteristic defensive behaviours – arching their neck (like the heel of a stiletto) or a jerking movement when they’re disturbed.  Residents are urged to contact professionals if they need a snake removed.  For more information or assistance, contact Crocworld Conservation Centre at 039 976 1103.
