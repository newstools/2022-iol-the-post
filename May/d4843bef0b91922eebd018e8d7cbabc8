Durban - The search continues for a municipal employee presumed to have drowned in Ogunjini, north of Durban, after his vehicle was discovered submerged in a river in the area. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the municipal employee went missing on Saturday night. Balram said Rusa received a call for assistance from a member of the public at about 10.46am when he noticed a portion of the roof of the white Toyota Etios protruding from the river. Reaction officers and Rusa medics were dispatched to the location. Balram said that on arrival, Rusa members found a large crowd had gathered on the banks of the river. It was confirmed that the driver lived in the area and could not be located since Saturday night’s floods. “His vehicle is believed to have been swept off a bridge after water levels from the river increased due to the heavy downpour. The vehicle was registered to the eThekwini Municipality Water Department. Two Rusa members entered the water and swam out to the vehicle. A search was conducted; however, it was confirmed that the driver was not in the car,” Balram said. He said the SAPS Search and Rescue Unit also conducted a search of the river around the car without success. Police could not been reached for comment by the time of publication.
