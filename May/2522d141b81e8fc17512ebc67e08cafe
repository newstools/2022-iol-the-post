Durban - Two men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Reservist Constable Malusi Mahlangu who was shot dead in KwaNdengezi in 2019. Hawks provincial spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the Durban High Court convicted and sentenced Mnqobi Mdluli, 29, and Siphosihle Philant, 34, to life imprisonment for murdering Mahlangu. Mahlangu was on duty at the Mariannhill satellite station when he was approached by the complainant whose tuck shop had been robbed. He proceeded to the said shop. Upon his arrival he was shot at and robbed of the State firearms, R5 rifle and his pistol. He was taken to the hospital for medical attention and was declared dead on arrival. Mhlongo said a case of murder was reported at KwaNdengezi police station and the case docket was allocated to the Hawks members from Durban Serious Organised Crime Investigation. “Three accused were arrested and charged with murder as well as two counts of robberies. They appeared in court several times until they were sentenced on Thursday. They were further sentenced to 30 years for robberies and the sentences will run concurrently,” Mhlongo said. When the Daily News reported on the incident in 2019, it said Mahlangu was making plans to wed the mother of his three daughters. The mother of his children, Zoleka Hamnca, said Mahlangu died at RK Khan Hospital after losing a lot of blood. Hamnca said the suspects also stole his cellphone, wallet and bank cards. “He loved his family, and he was excited about his birthday. On that day we had a celebration with just the five of us here at home, and that’s when he told me that he was working on plans for us to finally get married,” she said. Mahlangu was one of six of the 40 police officers that were killed between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, and honoured in 2020 at the annual SAPS Commemoration Day, in remembrance of the officers who lost their lives in the line of duty.
