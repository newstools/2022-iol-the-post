Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police have netted a suspect transporting R1.3 million worth of various drugs in Margate, South Coast. The arrest and seizure came days after police from the Provincial Drug and Firearm Unit arrested five suspects in separate operations for drug possession and drug dealing. One of the suspects also had an added charge of being in possession of counterfeit money. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said police from the Provincial Organised Crime Unit received information about a suspect who was travelling from Margate to transport drugs. She said observation was held on Saturday by the team and the vehicle was spotted travelling along Maureen Street in Margate. “The vehicle was intercepted and the driver was searched where 13 orange and white capsules of heroin were found in his jeans pocket,” Gwala said. “The vehicle was also searched and police found 26 bags of crystal meth, eight bags of cocaine uncut stones, 24 ecstasy tablets, four bags of plastics containing empty capsules, a weighing scale, one litre bottle of acetone chemical that is used to mix the drugs and 22 boxes of infant powder was also found. “The recovered drugs are valued at R1.3 million,” Gwala continued. She said a 42-year-old man was arrested for possession and dealing in drugs. He was expected to appear before the Ramsgate Magistrates' Court on Monday. Gwala said operations were conducted in Margate and across the province to curb drug-related crimes. Police officers were out in their numbers to clean up the province of drug dealings. She said that the use and abuse of drugs contribute to the commission of a crime and serious and violent crimes are being committed after the use of drugs. Daily News
