Durban - Security concerns have led to the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers deployed under Operation Chariot in KwaZulu-Natal to protect community halls where displaced families are living at present. Lieutenant Phuti Badimo said that the recent floods had left many people displaced in KZN. Therefore, as an interim measure, the eThekwini Municipality offered refuge to those who have lost their homes, in partnership with non-profit organisations and other stakeholders. “Due to security concerns, the SA National Defence Force has strategically positioned itself in those affected areas to elevate the security feature in the communities. By doing so, they safeguard various elements from unfavourable external factors which may affect the sustenance of those in dire need of resources,” Badimo said. Badimo said that the SANDF protection personnel were members who were  deployed for Operation Chariot. Last Wednesday, Maoti community ward councillor Nonceba Tyelinzima said: “The presence, service and support of the SA National Defence Force is gratifying. Things are operating smoothly and the displaced families are able to be sustained without interruption.” Here are the halls that the SANDF personnel are currently safeguarding: • Ntuzuma F Hall; • Ntuzuma B Hall; • Maoti Community Hall; • Tshelimnyama Community Hall; • Marianhill Ridge Community Hall and • Truro Hall – Westwood Daily News
