DURBAN: A vehicle that was stolen from Durban North on Wednesday night was recovered by Marshall Security in KwaMashu about 20 minutes after it was reported missing.  Earlier in the week, Marshall Security recovered a vehicle, in the Lindelani area, that was stolen during a house robbery in Reservoir Hills. Tyron Powell, the managing director of Marshall Security, said that in last night’s incident, just after 9.30pm, its Emergency Dispatch Centre was alerted to the theft of a motor vehicle on Ranleigh Crescent in Durban North.  “Multiple armed-response officers were dispatched to the scene and details of the stolen vehicle were circulated to all our members to be on the lookout.” Powell said it was established that the victim’s car keys had been stolen from his bag. “It was also established that the vehicle was fitted with a tracking device from Tracker SA. Tracker SA was alerted and members of our Special Operations Team were activated to assist with the stolen vehicle.” Powell added that Marshall Security members then responded to the last known location and, with the assistance of the Tracker ground team and the SAPS, recovered the vehicle. It has been abandoned on a dirt road in C Section KwaMashu.  “The scene was secured and will be investigated further by the SAPS.”   In a separate incident, Powell said a silver Mercedes-Benz, which was stolen during a house robbery in Reservoir Hills, was recovered in the Lindelani area by Marshall Security on Monday.
