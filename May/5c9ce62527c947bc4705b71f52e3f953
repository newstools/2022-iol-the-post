DURBAN: A woman, believed to be 42, was killed in an alleged drive-by shooting in the KwaMashu area north of Durban on Friday. Emer-G-Med Paramedics spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said the incident took place after 5pm at the intersection of Dumisani Makhaye Drive and Avoca Hills Drive. Van Reenen said when paramedics arrived on the scene, they found an orange Volkswagen Polo stationary at the intersection with a bullet hole in the passenger window. “The driver, a female, was found slumped over the steering wheel,” he said. According to Van Reenen, with the assistance and permission of the SAPS, the team used specialist rescue tools to gain access to the vehicle. “The driver was assessed and found to have sustained a fatal gunshot wound. She was declared dead on the scene,” he said. This comes after a spate of drive-by shootings in KZN since the beginning of the year. In a recent incident last week, three people were gunned down inside a vehicle on Chief Albert Luthuli Street in KwaDukuza (Stanger). In that incident, IPSS Medical Rescue said paramedics found three people inside a stationary vehicle. One person died at the scene, while the other two sustained critical injuries and were transported to different medical facilities. One was airlifted to a level one facility in the greater Durban area and the other was transported by Emergency Medical Response Service private ambulance service to a local facility in KwaDukuza.
