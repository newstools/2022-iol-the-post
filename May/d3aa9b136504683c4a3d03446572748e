Durban - Officers from the Provincial Trio and Vehicle Task Team have recovered three stolen vehicles and arrested four suspects within eThekwini. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said that in the first incident, the officers had received information about a vehicle wanted in connection with theft in Pietermaritzburg. The vehicle was reported to have entered the Newlands area, north of Durban. “Police and security officials immediately responded to the scene and the vehicle was spotted travelling on Cornfield Road in the Newlands area. The vehicle was then intercepted and three males found inside it were placed under arrest. It was established that the vehicle was stolen in the Pietermaritzburg area,” Gwala said. She said the suspects aged between 32 and 39 would appear before the Durban Magistrates' Court on charges of possession of stolen property. KZN VIP Protection Services spokesperson Gareth Naidoo added that at approximately 9.36am, KZN VIP control centre received reports via Fidelity ADT SIU (specialised intervention unit) that members of a vehicle that was used for a robbery had entered the Newlands area. All available response officers and tactical units were immediately dispatched to the location. He said the vehicle was a white Chevrolet bakkie. Gwala said that while the team was still in the same area, they spotted a vehicle that was travelling at high speed. The said vehicle was chased and intercepted. “Upon searching the suspect, he was found in possession of a pistol with rounds of ammunition. The investigation revealed that the firearm was stolen in Hammarsdale during July 2021,” Gwala said. She said the suspect, 22, was expected to appear in court on Monday.
