Durban - Opposition parties in the eThekwini Municipality were locked in caucus meeting at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Tuesday.  This could have led to the delay of eThekwini mayor councillor Mxolisi Kaunda delivering his State of the City Address for the 2022/2023 financial year on Tuesday.  Kaunda will be tabling the draft Integrated Development Plan and budget for the next financial year. The budget is geared towards ensuring economic recovery for the city following a string of unplanned events that have tested the resolve of the people and adversely affected the city’s economy. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the ripple effects of the Covid-19 national lockdown, the 2021 July unrest, two unprecedented floods within a six-week period, and a dwindling global economic environment have left the city’s leadership to reprioritise spend for the coming year. However, the proposed R54.6-billion draft budget reaffirms the city’s commitment to rebuilding. The address was scheduled to begin at 10am. Only city officials are seated in the ICC auditorium.  The State of the City Address will be followed by an ordinary eThekwini full council meeting. The composition of the eThekwini Municipality council is comprised of the following political parties and their allocated seats:  ANC 96; DA 59; EFF 24; IFP 16; ActionSA 4; Abantu Batho Congress (ABC) 2; Active Citizens Coalition (ACC) 2; African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) 2; African Independent Congress (AIC) 2; African Democratic Change (ADeC) 1; Al Jama 1; Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF) 1; ATM 1; DLC 1; JEP 1; KZNI 1; MF 1; Mosa 1; NFP 1; PFP 1; PRM 1; TA 1; UIM 1; and VF Plus 1.
