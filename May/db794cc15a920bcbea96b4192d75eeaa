Durban - Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, has once again set tongues wagging regarding the extravagant life he is reportedly living in Dubai, Middle East, where he is currently based. In a trailer-like recording which was uploaded to TikTok by Winston Innes, his close associate, Duduzane, the 40-year-old twin brother of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, is seen riding a luxurious sports car looking like a Maserati, which retails at around R3.5 million in South Africa. In a dark suit and clean fade haircut, Zuma junior does his famous walk and boards the car, and he is chauffeured around high-rise buildings with paved streets. He then disembarks to go into a luxurious place that looks like a hotel with a nightclub. The short video, which is 47 seconds long, then abruptly ends. In the video, Innes used the #dz22 hashtag which is normally used to lobby for Zuma junior as he eyes a senior political position in the ANC when it convenes its elective conference in December. The video sparked a debate, both on WhatsApp groups dominated by ANC members, and TikTok itself. Some TikTok users said it was an insult to the poor who Zuma junior intends to serve should he be elected to lead the ANC in seven months' time. Others, in his defence, said he was being unfairly targeted because he is a Zuma. They said he should be allowed to enjoy his wealth, and that those who are accusing him of getting it through dubious means must prove it. “There we go again with children of politicians showing off their cars, please show us the cars of the people who vote for them. Well, I am not implying anything,” one TikTok user named ronaldinhooo! commented. Other users posted comments that were blushing with emojis that are associated with affection. sihle.mavuso@inl.co.za Daily News
