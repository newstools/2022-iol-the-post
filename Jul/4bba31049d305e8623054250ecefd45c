ALS Paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said at around 7 am on Tuesday morning, paramedics responded to a serious taxi crash. When paramedics arrived at the scene, they found that the two vehicles had collided in the junction, and the taxi had veered off the roadway. Jamieson said the taxi struck a pedestrian on the pavement before coming to rest against the wall of a business premises.   “A quick triage revealed that 11 people had sustained various injuries,” he said. The injuries ranged from moderate to serious and more ambulances and Advanced Life Support paramedics were called to assist. “ALS Paramedics and Emergency Medical and Rescue Services stabilised all the patients and transported them through to various hospitals for the further care they required,” Jamieson said.
