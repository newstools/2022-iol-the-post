According to Natasha Kara, the provincial spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, the accused made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. “The matter was remanded to 10 August for the State to book a bed for the accused to undergo psychological evaluation.” Kara said the woman was remanded in police custody.  The 33-year-old accused is charged with the murder of her three-year-old daughter on May 31.  She cannot be named because she has another minor child.
