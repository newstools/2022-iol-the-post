Durban — The ANC in the Moses Mabhida region has expressed its distress by the recent surge in murders and other violent crime taking place within the uMgungundlovu District. The ANC was reacting to the shooting of patrons at a tavern in Sweetwaters, Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday night, which left four dead and eight fighting for their lives in hospital. Regional spokesperson Njabulo Mtolo said the anarchy was pushing their region to the brink. Mtolo said it has reached unprecedented levels, as criminals rob, hijack, kidnap and kill people daily to create unspeakable horror in communities. He said the basic principles articulated in the Freedom Charter and the Constitution – guarantee of safety, security and comfort; freedom of trade; and freedom of movement – have been severely curtailed. “While there is indeed a need for our public officials, the SAPS and other related law enforcement agencies to strengthen their capabilities, fighting crime should not be seen as the sole responsibility of the government, nor should it be reduced to a technocratic and bureaucratic task,” Mtolo said. He said only united action from the street and community level would free the community from crime. “As Moses Mabhida Region, we call on all our people to support and work with their street committees and CPFs in a united and consolidated manner to reclaim our streets,” Mtolo said. “We will further engage relevant police officials in an effort to devise strategies and mobilise additional resources, within our region, to assist in combating crime and ensure that our police are an effective instrument for servicing our people.” The region comprises the uMgungundlovu, Msunduzi and Richmond districts.
