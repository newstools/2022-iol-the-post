Durban — The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education has suspended Grosvenor Girls’ High School acting principal, who is the deputy principal, Mrs Birjraj, more than a week after an investigation by an independent panel found that racism at Grosvenor Girls High School is systematic, structural and that white authority dominates all facets at the school. The panel also found that racism is normalised and that it is second nature at this school, that black people who are pupils and employees at the school suffer in an atmosphere of being suppressed, oppressed and of being voiceless. In a statement, the department said the suspension derives from the backdrop of the recommendations made by the independent panel that investigated the allegations of racism and financial mismanagement at the school. “We are implementing the recommendations of the Independent Panel fully. We hope the findings and the recommendations thereof will become our point of reference for our education system,” said department head Nkosinathi Ngcobo. The panel was led by Advocate Vusi Khuzwayo (SC) and included Advocate Makhosini Nkosi, who is the evidence leader, Dr Nontobeko Buthelezi, who is an educational psychologist, Jackie Pretorius-Bishop and the secretariat was provided by SD Moloi Attorneys.

I have also directed legal services to lay a complaint against the principal with the Human Rights Commission.” Daily News
