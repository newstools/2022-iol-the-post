Durban — Royal AM owner Shauwn Mkhize has proven that soccer is not just for men after showcasing her kicking skills on the soccer pitch recently. Dressed in black, black stilettos, her braids down and her cellphone in her left hand, MaMkhize passed the ball with her right foot to a Royal AM FC player. MaMkhize, as she has become popularly known, took to Instagram to announce the beginning of a new journey. Captioning a series of photographs of her on the pitch with Royal AM players, MaMkhize said: “And so the journey begins. “Our new coach has been officially introduced to the players and I can’t wait to see how well everyone works together.  “We’ve got a mammoth task ahead but I know that everyone is ready to give 100%. “Now we focus on training and making sure that the boys @royalam_fc are physically and mentally prepared for the task at hand.” Reacting to the pass, the smile on her players faces says it all, they were impressed. A post shared by Dr. Shauwn Mkhize (@kwa_mammkhize) IOL reported that Khabo Zondo was named as the new coach of Royal AM. The former South Africa U20 coach succeeds John Maduka who surprisingly left the club at the end of last season despite earning praise last term and leading it to a surprise third-place finish in the league. Along with Zondo, Royal AM also announced that Thabo Maloka has joined the club as a physical trainer.  The 60-year-old Zondo will lead Thwihli Thwahla in the CAF Confederation Cup next season. We’re excited to introduce our HC Khabo Zondo, new physical trainer; Thabo Maloka and our new signees: Andre Ernest De Jong, Ketha Ndlovu, Samir Nurkovic and Ruzaigh Gamildien.💪🏽🙌🏽#royalam | #thwihlithwahla pic.twitter.com/AuDDy0bcBS Royal AM also unveiled four new signings in Andre De Jong, Khetha Ndlovu, Samir Nurkovic and Ruzaigh Gamildien.
