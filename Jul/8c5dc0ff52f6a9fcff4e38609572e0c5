Durban - The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) commemorated Mandela Day on Monday by holding a clean-up campaign in the area. Desmond D’sa from SDCEA said the world we live in can sometimes be very demoralising.  “We often find ourselves stuck in a rut with no motivation to move forward. Today however, 18 July, marks an incredible icon who worked and struggled for his people, who had nothing yet still strived to be a better person than he was the day before. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela will forever be a legend that we respect and look up to.” In 2009, the the United Nations General Assembly declared Nelson Mandela’s July 18 birthday as Nelson Mandela International Day. D’Sa said SDCEA staff together with communities of South Durban wanted to remind people of the enormous effort that the Nelson Mandela contributed to the country’s progressive environmental legislation that enable citizens to raise their voices to protect the environment. D’sa said Mandela inspired residents of South Durban as he listened and acted on their concerns in 1995 and giving back 67 minutes is the least that they could do.  The SDCEA staff and residents went to the Nelson Mandela Stone on Quality Street on Monday.  “The stone signifies the dignity and humility of Nelson Mandela the day he arrived in South Durban on Friday, March 23, 1995, to listen about the environmental concerns, ill health and pollution that the community suffered under.” D’Sa added that community members from Wentworth, Merebank and the SDCEA staff gave 67 minutes of their time to clean up the community and also made placards to create awareness about Mandela Day.  “By working together we can create a better tomorrow and ultimately a better and sustainable future.” THE MERCURY
