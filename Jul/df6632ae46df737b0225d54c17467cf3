Durban — A hiker who had fallen and injured a leg on the South Coast had to be stabilised and transported back by boat by emergency services. Kwazulu Private Ambulance spokesperson Craig Botha said late on Sunday morning, the service responded to the uMtamvuna Nature Reserve hiking trail for reports of a hiker that had fallen. Botha said that when emergency services arrived, they found that a hiker had fallen approximately 2km along the trail. “Paramedics together with National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), SAPS Search and Rescue and Ray Nkonyeni Fire and Rescue services hiked to the patient and found that the patient had sustained a serious injury to their leg,” Botha said. “The patient was stabilised and then transported by an NSRI boat back to a safe area where the ambulance was waiting to transport the patient to the hospital.” In February, a multi-disciplinary team of emergency services conducted a four-and-a-half-hour successful rescue of a patient with a suspected broken leg. Specialised Tactical Accident Rescue Team (START) spokesperson Warren Brauns said they were activated to the Kloof Gorge for a rescue. “The team was sent to assist a person that fell on a trail, with reports of a possible broken leg,” Brauns said. The rescue service’s control centre dispatched START partners Netcare 911 Rescue, Netcare 911 advanced life support paramedic and ambulance, RescueTech Search and Rescue, as well as the Neighbourhood Watches in the area. Additional to this, the Fire Department, together with Metro Search and Rescue members, were dispatched. “A multi-operational service was done to find, treat and carry the patient from the gorge to the ambulance to be taken to hospital for the further care that was needed,” Brauns said. Rescuetech Search and Rescue added that it was the first official call out for Rescuetech Search and Rescue under the umbrella of START Rescue. Daily News
