Durban- KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala and members of the provincial Government will launch Men’s month with a march in Durban on Tuesday. The Premier’s office said the march is an initiative of the provincial government.  “It is also supported by the KZN Provincial Men’s Forum and seeks to tackle challenges men are grappling with in the home, at work and society at large.” The Premier’s Office added that men played a crucial role in promoting gender equality.  “The provincial government recognises men as critical role players in advocating gender equality and calls on men, as partners, to take a stand and fight patriarchal values that lead to violence against women and children.” Traditional leaders will also be present at the march. “During the march, Premier Zikalala will be joined by Members of the Executive Council, KZN Provincial House of Traditional and Koi-San Leaders and the KZN Provincial Men’s Forum.” The Premier’s office added that programmes will be taking place throughout Men's Month to engage men on current issues the face. The march is expected to start at 10 am from King Dinuzulu Park and proceed along the Durban Central Business District and ending at City Hall. The KwaZulu-Natal Government also uses Men’s Month to create awareness of the scourge of Gender Based Violence. THE MERCURY
