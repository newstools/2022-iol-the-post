​Durban — eThekwini Municipality ward councillor Sakhile Mngadi said crime has increased in the Davenport area. Mngadi said that 10 years ago the city undertook an effort of creating business precincts outside of the central business district as a means to stimulate economic activities. One of these precincts is the Davenport precinct in ward 33 which covers Glenwood, Umbilo and Bulwer. Mngadi said that of late, there have been escalated instances of mugging, pickpocketing, hijacking and armed robbery in the area. This is mostly due to the fact that visitors to this area come for entertainment and are most vulnerable when leaving. “I have engaged the metro and asked that both Metro and SAPS have increased visibility on all days on the road but especially from Thursday - Sunday which are peak periods,” Mngadi said. He said business owners have also donated additional security to assist with this, such as Empire Cafe, which has also donated increased security to patrol the street in the coming months. “We are grateful as a community for this,” Mngadi said. “Our CPF and community forums are also aware and I’ve noted the great work they are doing in keeping our community safe.” Mngadi said the first ward committee meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 27, 2022, and this item will form part of the agenda. “To the criminals who think my ward is open for business. You will be caught and I will ensure that the law rains down very hard on you!” said Mngadi. The Umbilo Community Policing Forum, Umbilo police and private security companies have been active and on the ground. Recently, they have made numerous arrests and conducted stop-and-search operations and patrols in the Umbilo policing precinct. Last Friday, three men were arrested for the possession of unlicensed firearms, the possession of unlicensed ammunition and impersonating a police officer. Daily News
