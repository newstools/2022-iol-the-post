MELANIE Kisten will bring her stage production – The Bread, The Porridge and the Mix Masala to Suncoast at the The Globe this weekend. The show ran to sold-out audiences in 2017 and returns with what Kisten said was another twist with a different tale. A mix of comedy, drama, dance and music, the story focuses on the hardships of marriage, family and betrayal. The production features Kisten, Bhavanie Kisten, Desiree Kisten, Lyle D Chellan, Thiru Reddy, Sagie Kisten, Elaine Govender, Kubeshan Naidoo and Lucian Govender. “I started scripting in July 2017 to stage in October 2017. I have friends and families who have had issues with marrying into different castes and they had endless dramas in their marriages because of it. I wanted to stage this production to show people that no matter what caste you belong to, love, honesty and care conquers all,” said Kisten. She said the production was based on reality. “Many can relate and there was always the bread-porridge (Hindi/Tamil) clash in society, so I guess people were curious to see what drama unfolded for it to become a mix masala. The production is a family show and it is scripted to bring light hearted humour, together with morals and values, as sometimes people need to realise that all that glitters is not gold.” Kisten said the plot had developed further since its first staging. “There are some changes – of a few of the characters (cast members), the music, and up to date humour, together with a small-big surprise. “Over the past two years, life has changed and the entertainment industry suffered great losses, from artists to promoters to theatres. Artists are now finally getting the opportunity to go out and do what they love doing again and that is to entertain patrons. Laughter will certainly be the best medicine. After all,  the saying still stands that local is lekker.” The Bread, The Porridge and the Mix Masala is being staged on July 30 at 7pm. Tickets are priced from R150 via Computicket. POST
