Durban - Two vehicles were recovered swiftly by Mi7 armed response units in two separate incidents in the Pietermaritzburg area.  In the most recent incident on Saturday, a hijacked vehicle was recovered in Barnsley Road and in an incident on Thursday night, a stolen vehicle was recovered in the Townhill area. Mi7 National Group said that on Saturday morning at around 4am the National group’s control room operators received a message from a community group requesting assistance in the Camps Drift area after a number of suspects hijacked a vehicle.  “Mi7 Armed Response units were immediately dispatched. Reaction officers, within a matter of minutes of searching the area, found the vehicle abandoned on Barnsley Road.” Mi7 added that according to the owner, the vehicle was being used as an e-hailing service.  “When the owner received word that it was stolen, she activated a remote panic device which turned the vehicle off automatically. The matter was handed over to the police for further investigation.” Mi7 said in the second incident on Thursday night, its Strategic Threat Response Unit officers received information from a security-related chat group regarding a vehicle that had been stolen from the parking lot of a popular shopping district in the Chase Valley area.  “Mi7 officers were then contacted by members of the vehicle’s tracking company for assistance, having provided the last known location of the vehicle according to the tracking device.” Mi7 added that due to the large number of Mi7 units already patrolling the Townhill area, reaction officers were able to quickly mobilise to search for the vehicle.  “After only 30 minutes, the Mi7 Reaction Officers spotted the abandoned vehicle. The vehicle was successfully recovered and the matter handed over to the police for further investigation.” THE MERCURY
