Durban — Police recovered a firearm that was used in a murder while responding to a business robbery in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday night. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said on Wednesday at 7.40pm, Mountain Rise police responded to a business robbery at a tuck shop in Cinderella Park, Eastwood. Ngcobo said when police arrived at the scene, they learnt that four men had arrived in a vehicle at the premises and threatened the victim with a firearm. “They allegedly stole cash, cigarettes, airtime vouchers and other items before fleeing the scene.” Ngcobo said police immediately alerted all units and neighbouring police stations. “Police officers traced the suspects’ vehicle to Unit 2, Imbali, where they arrested two suspects aged 27 and 30. One of the suspects was found in unlawful possession of a pistol with 20 rounds of ammunition. Police also recovered some of the stolen property from the suspects,” Ngcobo said. “Investigation revealed that the recovered firearm was involved in a case of murder reported on June 28, where a 40-year-old man was shot and killed while at France in Pietermaritzburg. A case of murder is under investigation at Alexandra Road SAPS.” Ngcobo said both suspects would appear before the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of business robbery as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.
