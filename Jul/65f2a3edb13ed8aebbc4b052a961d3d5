Durban - Petros M Mokoena, who was found guilty of rape in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Friday, was expected back in court on Wednesday ahead of his sentencing. Last year in January Mokoena was caught in the act by his victim's sons who found him shirtless in their mother’s bed. He offered R1 000 to the sons before fleeing, leaving behind some of his belongings. The state’s evidence was that Mokoena left behind a backpack, sandals, and a golf shirt. The accused, who was a family friend, entered the home and went into the woman’s bedroom.  During the trial, the court heard the victim say she had recognised the voice of the accused. The woman’s son, after finishing the washing, walked into the house to hear sounds of a struggle. When he entered her room, he found Mokoena raping his mother. Mokoena, when fleeing the victim’s house, came across a member of the community  who asked him what had happened. He told the resident that the victim’s children had mugged him, taking his clothes. He maintained that he did not rape the victim but that it was consensual and the victim’s sons had walked in on them and assaulted him. The matter was adjourned to Wednesday July 13 for a social worker's report to be presented to the court before a sentence is handed down to Mokoena. Daily News
