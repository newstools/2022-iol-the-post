Durban: Ithuba said it was searching for the winner who bagged more than R3 million in Saturday night’s Lotto Plus 2 jackpot.

Ithuba encouraged players to check their tickets and approach the regional office, to process their winnings. “With amounts bigger than R50 000, we always have a team of financial advisers and psychologists, who assist with debriefing our winners, as winning large amounts of money may cause a form of trauma or shock,” said Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza.  “As for our financial advisers, they are there to guide our winners and advise them of the different investment portfolios or opportunities.” The Powerball jackpot for Tuesday night’s draw is estimated at R86m.
