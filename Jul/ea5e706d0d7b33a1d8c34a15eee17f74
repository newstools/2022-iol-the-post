Durban — Three KwaZulu-Natal men imprisoned for murder, attempted murder, and robbery in 2014 appealed their convictions in the Durban High Court on Monday. They were sentenced and convicted for robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder and attempted murder that occurred at Vulindlela Liquor Bar in Mtunzini, northern KZN, in 2012. The trio attacked a tavern in Mtunzini where the owner, Mduduzi Innocent Nzimande, was stabbed to death. His security guard, Bonginkosi Gina, and tenant Nkululeko Mnguni were shot twice in the chest. Philani Velemseni Khwanazi, Thabani Sithole and Christopher Chili were sentenced in 2014. They are serving 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, another 15 for the attempted murder, and life for Nzimande’s murder. Gina, a witness, testified that he had been in the tavern at the time of the attack. When he was about to leave with Nzimande he saw the attackers rush towards them and that was when he heard gunshots. Nzimande and Gina retreated back into the tavern and closed the door. Court papers state that Gina found a bush knife and armed himself. However, he was shot twice in his chest. He was able to identify Sithole as the person who shot him. Gina testified that the other two men were carrying knives which they used to stab Nzimande and wound Gina. The men demanded the keys to Nzimande’s room but Gina did not know where it was. Gina was then forced to the back of the tavern complex to Mnguni’s room. The three men then pretended to be police officers when they knocked on Mnguni’s door. When he opened the door he was shot and robbed. Daily News
