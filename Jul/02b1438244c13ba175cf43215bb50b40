Durban — The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has advised that the erection of temporary lighting will lead to the closure of the N3 from Sanctuary Road to Link Road for a few days. To provide enough space for the safe installation of the infrastructure, the fast lane on the northbound carriageway will need to be closed daily from July 21 to July 29, between the hours of 9am and 3pm. Sanral Eastern Region project manager Thabiso Dladla said: “In an attempt to improve road safety in the area temporary lighting will be installed on a portion of the N3 between Sanctuary Road and Link Road (between km 16.2 and km 18.4). The work entails the installation of numerous 14m long poles in the median between the two carriageways.” Light motor vehicles can use the Old Howick Road (R103) as an alternative route. Motorists travelling from Pietermaritzburg towards Harrismith can use the Old Howick Road and can join the N3 either at Hilton or Cedara. All vehicles above 8-ton may not use the R103 and should allow for extra time for their journey. “Sanral wishes to apologise to the motoring public for any inconvenience caused during the road closure. We appeal to road users to adhere to the road signs and speed limit when approaching the construction site,” Dladla said. Daily News
