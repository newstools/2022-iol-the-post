Durban — To ensure a seamless customer experience and improved service delivery, a decision was made to integrate the eThekwini Municipality’s three call centres. On Tuesday, eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda led members of the executive committee on an oversight visit to the municipal call centres to assess their functionality. The municipality presently has three call centres for water, electricity and revenue services. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said that a decision has already been taken that they need to be integrated to the benefit of the public. He said Kaunda has since instructed management to ensure that they move with speed for this process to take off the ground. He also instructed management to attend to labour-related matters so that they do not impede this important integration process. Kaunda said the backlog at the call centres is a major challenge for residents and following a study to determine the effectiveness and functioning of these call centres, a decision to integrate them was taken. He said he was confident that in the next three months, the integration process will be completed. “We are working to get the new system up and running with the aim of achieving improved customer satisfaction. We have also tasked senior management to iron out all labour-related matters, so it doesn’t hinder the integration process or improved customer satisfaction,” Kaunda said. Daily News
