Durban — The Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court has sentenced Siboniso Bethell Zwane whose mini-bus taxi ploughed into a group of Newlands East schoolgirls in 2019, killing three of them. On Tuesday Magistrate H Sevlall handed Zwane an 8-year prison sentence for the three culpable homicides and reckless and negligent driving. Ayanda Mtshali‚ Thima Ngiba‚ both 14‚ and 13-year-old Luyanda Ngubane were on their way to school with other children when Zwane’s taxi hit them. They they were standing on a pavement at the intersection of Dumisani Makhaye Drive and Inanda Road. After the crash Zwane fled and handed himself over to police as angry community members blockaded Dumisani Makhaye Road at the intersection leading to KwaMashu, Ntuzuma and Newlands East. The community demanded that the identity of the driver be revealed and for more safety measures at the intersection. Zwane was released on R3 000 bail. Zwane was convicted in May and has been in custody since. Sentencing proceedings began in June. His family were present in court. Zwane’s defence had been lobbying for a non-custodial sentence.
