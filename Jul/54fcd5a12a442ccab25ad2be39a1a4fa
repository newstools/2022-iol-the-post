Durban - A man accused of stealing a car battery allegedly hanged himself in the Durban Magistrate’s Court holding cells on Wednesday.  He was expected to appear in court on Thursday after his matter was adjourned on Wednesday for a plea. Department of Justice and Constitutional Development spokesperson Steve Mahlangu confirmed that a 31-year-old man who was appearing in D Court on charges of theft had died following a suspected suicide in the holding cells.  “Investigations are currently under way by the police to determine what transpired. Information at our disposal suggests that the suspect hanged himself in the holding cells. Further details will emerge as the investigation into the matter takes shape,” Information the Daily News has is that Sherwin Naidoo of Cato Manor was facing a charge of theft out of a motor vehicle where it was alleged that on July 12 in Carnforth Avenue, Bonela, the accused stole a car battery from a parked Chery QQ3. Naidoo made his first appearance in court on July 13 where he applied for legal aid representation. The State opposed bail based on issues with his home address and profile. He was remanded in custody and the case was adjourned to July 20 for bail information. Naidoo appeared before Magistrate Hariram, on Tuesday, where the State maintained it was still opposed to bail. Naidoo’s defence then elected to render a plea in the matter. He was remanded in custody again for plea on Thursday. Daily News
