Durban – The owner of a local Bed & Breakfast has been arrested for allegedly being in possession of two hijacked vehicles, north of Durban. Marshall Security managing director, Tyron Powell, said a bread and breakfast owner was arrested after their teams uncovered two hijacked vehicles found parked on the property in the Glen Ashley area on Monday evening. Powell said at approximately at 10pm, members of their Special Operations Team, together with the Tracker ground team and the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit, went to a well-known bed and breakfast in Glen Ashley. They had received information that a wanted hijacked vehicle was parked on the property. “While conducting their investigation on the property, members found a white Mercedes-Benz C200 AMG that had been hijacked in the Wentworth area in May this year.  “Upon questioning, the keys for the Mercedes-Benz were found in possession of the owner of the B&B. He couldn’t provide police officers with a reasonable explanation as to how he came to possess the keys of the hijacked vehicle and was immediately arrested,” Powell said. “Upon further investigation, our teams found yet another hijacked vehicle on the property – a white BMW SUV that had been hijacked last year September in the Mayville area. The B&B owner was also in possession of the keys for this vehicle. Again, he couldn’t give a reasonable explanation as to how he had obtained them.” Powell added that both vehicles and the B&B owner were taken to the Durban North police station for further processing.  The suspect would be charged on two counts of being in possession of suspected stolen property, he said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of possession of stolen property is being investigated by Durban North SAPS and a 36-year-old man was found in possession of two stolen vehicles. The suspect appeared before the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Daily News
