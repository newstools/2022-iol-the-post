Durban — The Ladysmith farming community has been rocked by the murder of one of their own and the injuring of another during a shooting on Wednesday night. Reports of the incident were reported by DA uThukela constituency head Alf Lees who condemned the murder and attack on the prominent Ladysmith farmers. “Both farmers were shot multiple times while at the Truck Stop outside Ladysmith last night (Wednesday),” Lees said. “The victims of this shooting, Gerry Khumalo, who is injured and in hospital, and Sibusiso Gama, who was killed, are successful commercial farmers in the Ladysmith area,” he said. The DA extended its condolences to the Gama and Khumalo families. “We call on the police to make every possible effort to identify the perpetrators of this gruesome crime as well as the motives for it. The perpetrators must face the harshest possible consequences for their actions,” Lees said. He added that the DA requested time and again that a special task team be established to deal with ongoing attacks on our rural communities. “Regrettably, our calls keep falling on deaf ears. Farmers are critical to our survival in this country, and the attacks on them are being ignored,” he said. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said that on Wednesday at 11.30pm, Ladysmith police were called to R103 Road. “On arrival they were shown the body of a 38-year-old with multiple gunshot wounds. The other male aged 57, was rushed to hospital for medical attention,” Ngcobo said. “It is alleged that the victims were at a business premises when an unknown suspect opened fire, fatally wounding one man whilst the other one was taken to hospital.” She said a case of murder and attempted murder was is investigated by Ladysmith police.
