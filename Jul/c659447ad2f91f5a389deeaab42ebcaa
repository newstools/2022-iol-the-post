Durban - Following the recent breaks in the city’s fibre lines which led to prepaid electricity e-services being inactive, the eThekwini Municipality has expressed its concerns about vandalism and damage to infrastructure. eThekwini says the breaks that affect its fibre infrastructure are caused by various factors that include vandalism, construction, cable theft and vehicle accidents. In the most recent case, it said the primary link was affected by vandalism and the secondary link was affected by construction. When there are breaks in the fibre lines and the prepaid electricity e-services are down, residents of eThekwini Municipality are forced to purchase tokens at selected Sizakala centres and not conveniently via their phones. City spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela says the municipality has since engaged with the fibre companies to make them aware of necessary procedures to undertake for any work to be approved. “Fibre companies are also made aware of location of power lines depending on where they will be working. As per their agreement with the city, they are also liable for all damages incurred during installations. A dedicated team of electricians will be on standby to deal with any electricity faults.” Mayisela says residents must report any vandalism to the city. “Should breaks of this nature occur in future, the customers are encouraged to alternatively purchase electricity through the customer service centres and Sizakalas conveniently located across the city (Mpumalanga, Pinetown, Clermont, KwaDabeka, Kingsburgh, Hillcrest, Thongathi, Isipingo, Rotunda, uMhlanga, Florence Mkhize Building, Phoenix.),” he said.
