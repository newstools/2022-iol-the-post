Durban — A woman is expected to appear before the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court after she was arrested for allegedly killing and burying her baby. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said that on Tuesday, at 2pm, Inanda police were called out to Amaoti, north of Durban, where the community had apprehended a 25-year-old woman who was suspected of killing her baby. “On arrival at the scene police established that the community had forced the woman to dig up the shallow grave where the remains of her baby were buried,” Ngcobo said. “The woman was arrested and detained at Inanda SAPS where she was charged with birth concealment, while the body of the baby was transported to a local mortuary.” Ngcobo said it was alleged that the woman was pregnant and when she was found without a baby, the neighbours became suspicious and interrogated her. She later told neighbours that the child had died. She said the woman will appear before the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Daily News
