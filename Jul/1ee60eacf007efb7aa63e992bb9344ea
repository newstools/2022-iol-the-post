Durban — A teacher from KwaZulu-Natal successfully represented the province in the interprovincial squash tournament earlier this month. Umar Hoosen, 22, a teacher at Curro Salt Rock High School on the Dolphin Coast, is full of smiles after triumphantly representing the region at the Growthpoint Interprovincial Squash tournament held in East London between July 10-15, 2022. Hoosen is a Grade 8 mathematics teacher and a Grade 10 to 12 Computer Application Technology teacher who performed incredibly well, winning three of his five games. As a result, he has now been ranked sixth on the entire Dolphin Coast. “It has been a privilege and honour to represent my province, and this is certainly a week I will never forget. The exposure, relationships and bonds I formed have been tremendous, and it has only motivated me to keep training and improving,” Hoosen said. “Squash is a game of strategy – to outwit your opponent, you inevitably become a problem-solver, and I hope I can show my students that this strategy can be applied to overcome whatever challenges life throws at them too.” Hoosen, a previous cricket player and past Umhlali Country Club champion, only started playing squash in 2019 but quickly excelled, rising to become one of the top ten players in KZN North Coast. Hoosen has already started training hard for his next tournament, the South African Squash National Qualifiers in Durban, during August and September 2022. Curro Salt Rock executive head Bryn Thomas said: “At Curro, we are accustomed to sharing the remarkable extracurricular achievements of our learners, so it is exceptionally refreshing to be able to celebrate the fantastic triumphs of our teachers too. We hope Mr Hoosen’s successes both on the squash court and in the classroom will continue to encourage learners to work hard and remain focussed and committed.” Daily News
