Durban - The DA in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) says it is deeply disturbed by the ongoing political killings in the province after the brutal murder of Imbambabukhos Samson Dlani Buthelezi yesterday in Nquthu.  DA KZN spokesperson on CoGTA, Martin Meyer says KZN traditional leaders are living under constant threat, their ability to do their work without fear or favour is being affected and families are being left without fathers, brothers and sons. “The DA extends its condolences to the family and to the families of all other KZN traditional leaders who have lost their lives so violently and unnecessarily.” The party says it will be consulting widely with stakeholders to find real solutions to address the ongoing scourge. “Traditional leadership play an important role in our province and the ongoing killings are an indictment against KZN’s ANC leadership. They are also an indication of the lack of political tolerance and good governance within our province,” said Meyer. The DA feels the KZN government is unable to deal with the  ongoing threat. “This despite the fact that more than 300 cases of political violence have been opened at KZN SAPS stations since 2018 and four traditional leaders have been murdered since September last year. “In 2018, President Ramaphosa established an inter-ministerial task team to combat this scourge. Yet, to date, there has been no feedback to the KZN Legislature when it comes to the work being conducted and the killings continue,“ he said. Meyer has taken the matter beyond the provincial level. “The DA has also raised the matter in the National Council of Provinces. This took place on June 21. “Our province cannot continue to be a place of political bloodshed. The DA is committed to working with all stakeholders to curb this scourge,” he added. THE MERCURY
