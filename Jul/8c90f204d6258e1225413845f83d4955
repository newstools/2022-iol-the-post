Durban – A 29-year-old man was fatally wounded after suspects fleeing from a home invasion in Jackal Road in Waterloo, Verulam shot him on Monday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said Rusa received a call for assistance before 12am on Sunday night. Balram said when Rusa members arrived at the scene it was established that two armed suspects held up a man, as he was entering his house. He said the suspects robbed the occupants of the house of six cell phones. “As they were exiting they shot the 29-year-old neighbour in the neck,” said Balram. Balram said witnesses were unable to confirm if the suspects intended to rob the neighbour or if he had attempted to apprehend them. “The man was rushed privately to a medical facility where he was declared deceased,” he said.
