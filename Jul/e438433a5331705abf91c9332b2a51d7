Durban - Motorists who double park or park in illegal areas among other road offences could soon find their vehicles towed by the Msunduzi Municipality which has acquired its own tow truck. Msunduzi Municipality unveiled its first tow truck this week in an effort to tackle lawlessness and to restore law and order in the city. The city is faced with a myriad challenges when it comes to law enforcement regarding cars parked illegally or blocking traffic. “The truck has been procured with an intention to provide a more responsive law enforcement service and improve reliability in the level of services provided to the residents of Msunduzi by dealing with by-law infringement,” said the city. In the quest to restore law and order in the city, Mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla said the municipality sought to improve on how it dealt with road users who disregarded the law. “Our traffic officers are more visible on the ground, they are issuing fines and checking if motorists have any warrant of arrest. “The municipality did not have a tow truck but now we can confidently say that we will not tolerate anyone who does not follow the rules of our roads” said Thebolla. Thebolla warned motorists and public transport operators to obey the rules of the road, adding that once a vehicle had been towed, there would be charges for towing and storage of the vehicle. “Traffic law enforcement operations have been intensified to ensure the safety of the community of Msunduzi,” he said.
