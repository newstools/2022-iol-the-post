Durban - In yet another mass shooting, six men were killed on Saturday night in Savannah Park,  Mariannhill, west of Durban. According to a police statement, it is alleged that a group of unknown men opened fire at people who were at a tuckshop at about 7:30 in the evening. The victims range in age from 30 to 65, and one survivor who suffered gunshot wounds was taken to hospital for treatment, according to the police. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said the police have mobilised all available resources to hunt down the heartless killers. “Initial investigations revealed that three of the deceased were the tuckshop owner as well as his two sons and one of the deceased who was waiting at the tuckshop to see a traditional healer, might have been the actual target of the hit." The incidents comes as the nation was still reeling from several mass shootings in taverns that took place in Orlando, Katlehong, GaRankuwa in Gauteng and Sweetwaters,  Pietermaritzburg, a few weeks back where 24 people were killed. Last week police arrested four men in connection with a shooting in the Pietermaritzburg tavern where four people were killed. They appeared in court last week where they were denied bail pending further investigation. Mkhwanazi said the incident demonstrated their concerns about firearms that end up in the wrong hands. “This incident once again demonstrates our concern that firearms are contributing to the high levels of crime in the province and we are advocating for stricter regulations regarding the management of legal firearms as many of them end up being used by criminals. We will do everything within our control to bring these killers to book,” said Lieutenant General Mkhwanazi. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
