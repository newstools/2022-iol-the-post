Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has applauded the community of Sobantu Township in Pietermaritzburg for standing up against violence directed at women and children.  Khoza was speaking to community members outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday, after attending the case of Njabulo Ndlovu, who pleaded guilty to charges of rape and murder of three people. Ndlovu, 29, who was accused of raping and strangling to death Zanele Ndlela, 65, her daughter Simangele Ndlela, 46, and an 8-year-old granddaughter, Zenande Ndlela, in their home in June this year, pleaded guilty to all charges and will be sentenced next week. Khoza, who had come to give support to the Ndlela family, told the crowd outside the high court she hoped their activism against abuse of women and children would encourage other communities to do the same. “What you have done, coming here today to support the Ndlela family, is commendable and should done by communities across the province until this scourge is dealt with in the province, because the attacks on women and children are  real,”  she told the crowd. She noted that there had been many instances of abuse reported in many parts of the province in recent months. The MEC said they were hoping for a heavy sentence, as this would send a warning that abuse would not be tolerated. "We want to see this heartless man rot in jail. It is important that we make our voice heard and we want to see justice for all women and children who face abuse, rape and murders in our communities," she added.  Khoza appealed to everyone to join the fight against abuse. THE MERCURY
