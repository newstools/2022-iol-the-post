Durban — KwaZulu-Natal healthcare fraternity is mourning the death of a young ophthalmologist, Dr Noluthando Gadu Pupuma, 39, who lost her battle with breast cancer earlier this month. Pupuma is also mourned by the communities she served, Netcare The Bay Hospital and all who knew her.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ Netcare The Bay Hospital general manager Mduduzi Ngubane said: “On behalf of the staff and doctors at Netcare The Bay Hospital, we again convey our deepest condolences to Dr Noluthando Pupuma’s family, her husband Dr Xanti Pupuma, and their three children who survive her.” Pupuma obtained her MBCHB and M.Med and FC Ophth at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and qualified as a specialist in 2015. Her career in eye health started as a medical officer at Ngwelezana Hospital, and she later joined Edendale Hospital. She spent four years at Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg during her specialist training, then returned to Ngwelezana Hospital in 2015. In 2018, Dr Pupuma started her own private practice at Netcare The Bay Hospital, where her husband also practises as the lead gynaecologist, and she continued to serve the community through her sessional work at Ngwelezana Hospital. Dr Pupuma tragically lost her oldest son and her brother in a motor vehicle accident in May this year. She was the first female black ophthalmologist to begin practising in the Richards Bay and Empangeni area and was known as a powerful advocate for women’s empowerment and served as an inspiration to many. “Dr Pupuma leaves a legacy as an exceptional, caring healthcare provider and respected ophthalmologist, who will forever be remembered for her passion for life and helping others to ‘see the world with new eyes,” Ngubane added. A church service to celebrate Pupuma’s life was held at St Andrew’s Anglican Church, 16 Elweboog Road, Meerensee, Richards Bay. A memorial service was held at the Ngwelezane Hospital Nurses Home Hall. Daily News
