Durban — Furniture store the Leather Gallery has reported that the blue San Pablo leather corner sofa, the looted couch, has returned home to Springfield after a tour.

In a Facebook post on Friday, Leather Gallery said Pablo was back. The post, in the form of a poster, read: “Pablo has arrived at Springfield, his original home. Come visit him at 20 Intersite Avenue. He won’t be there for a long time though. Stay tuned to his journey to find out where Pablo goes to next…”  South Africans reacted with characteristic humour and a dash of mirth Thato Tsautse said: “I am happy Pablo is back home. He needs to get a bit of counselling.” Bonnie Ngema said: “But Admin please tell us, what happened to Pablo's 'Adoptive Parents'?? I am really curious ...” Noksie Kunene gushed: “Pablo, oh Pablo you lootable beauty! Welcome back home and stay safe.” Nicole Amanda Cain was curious about the adoptive parents: “Yes, I would like to know who that mama is sitting on him in the picture??!!” Moira Ncube-Mabanga said: “To think he was a street kid for some days… life is tough on the streets. Hope he gets counselling and recovers. Welcome back blue child.” Mabaleng Mokonyama felt Pablo deserved a place in history saying must never be sold but put in a museum. Fikile Mabhena said: “He's still traumatised sheeeem, had sleepless nights, he needs to tell us how was his experience in the bhudus.” Didi Zulu said Pablo was “a  looting survivor” and welcomed him home. IOL reported that Pablo, worth almost R70 000 was found in Quarry Road West Informal Settlement towards the end of July and later restored before going on tour. Leather Gallery’s co-owner Greg Parry said the couch was taken on tour in Gauteng and featured in the malls where their stores are located. Daily News
