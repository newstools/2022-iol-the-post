Durban — Three friends have been sentenced after being charged with robbery and the possession of illegal firearms and suspected stolen property. Mandla Xesibe, 33, Thabo Banga Qulo, 29, and Sphamandla Bright Dlamini, 24, appeared in the Durban Regional Court on July 13, 2022, on charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of suspected stolen property as well as unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said the provincial Organised Crime Unit arrested the three friends during an intelligence-driven operation in 2019. The officers had followed up on information which led them to Bluff Road in Clairwood where they spotted a vehicle. The vehicle was searched and two firearms, ammunition and jewellery, which were allegedly stolen in Brighton Beach, were recovered. The accused failed to provide proof of ownership when they were questioned about the items. Ngcobo said when the three were arrested, it was discovered that Xesibe was also wanted for a robbery case, which was reported in Umkomaas on July 7, 2019, where construction workers were robbed of their belongings. The accused and his friends allegedly instructed the victims to lie down before they stole their bank cards and demanded their pin codes. They drove with the victims and dropped them at Umlazi. She said the accused made several court appearances before they were sentenced. “Xesibe was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for robbery, and unlawful possession of a firearm, Qulo was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for possession of stolen property wholly suspended for five years, and Dlamini was given 10 years’ imprisonment for possession of stolen property wholly suspended for five years,” Ngcobo said.
