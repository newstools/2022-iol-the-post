Durban - Luck ran out for two men who were caught by members of the Mi7 National Group in separate incidents after they allegedly broke into businesses in Howick and Pietermaritzburg this weekend. Group director Colin David said earlier this morning that Mi7 Armed Response was dispatched after a request for assistance from a community group for the Pietermaritzburg CBD area. David said It is believed that one suspect, wearing a black jacket and pants with reflective tape, broke into a business property in the CBD and made off with cash. He said Mi7 reaction officers, along with members from other security companies, patrolled the CBD in search of the suspect. Eventually, teams spotted the man on Retief Street, he said. “When searched, he was found in possession of the stolen cash,” said David. He added that the suspect was apprehended and handed over to the police for further investigation.   In a separate incident early on Saturday, David said, the Mi7 National Group, along with various other security companies, received reports that a suspect was attempting to gain entry into business premises on Harvard Street in Howick. David said Mi7 reaction officers were immediately dispatched to the location, along with members from other security companies. He said the teams strategically cordoned the area off and entered the premises through a door that was found ajar. “They found one suspect in the store, attempting to steal clothing items. The suspect was successfully apprehended and the matter handed to the police for further investigation,” said David. “As management, we applaud the combined effort of all security companies and stakeholders involved in the arrest. It is only by working together as members of the security cluster that we can hope to eradicate crime in our communities.”   THE MERCURY
