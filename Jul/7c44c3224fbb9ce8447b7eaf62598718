Durban — A cash-in-transit (CIT) driver was shot dead during a heist in Kokstad, south of KwaZulu-Natal, on Monday morning. Fidelity Services Group chief executive Wahl Bartmann said that at 8.04am in the morning, a Fidelity CIT team in Kokstad was ambushed en route to their base by six heavily armed gunmen. He said the suspects rammed the Fidelity vehicle, unfortunately fatally shooting the driver. The two remaining crewmen were able to escape when the suspects set the vehicle alight. Bartmann said the suspects were not able to access any of the cash in the vehicle. “Our sincere condolences go out to the family of our deceased officer. “The attacks are occurring with increasing regularity and although less or no money is being stolen, there is enormous disregard for the sanctity of life and this senseless loss of life is just not acceptable. Vehicles are also being destroyed unnecessarily which just adds to the overall resource cost,” Bartmann said. He said that any information from the public is welcome and should be communicated immediately to their tip-off number - for WhatsApp, sms, or please call 083 939 0300 or call 011 766 6061. Police have been approached for comment. In May, a gang of gunmen unsuccessfully tried to rob a CIT vehicle in Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal, on a Monday morning. SBV confirmed there was an attempted CIT attack on an SBV team in the Ixopo area. Three SBV employees were attacked by the gunmen who surrounded the SBV vehicle and opened fire. SBV Services chief executive Mark Barrett confirmed one of the SBV employees was injured during the attack and was receiving medical attention. He also confirmed no cash was taken. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda said KZN police were investigating cases of attempted murder and attempted cash in transit following a failed CIT robbery along the R56 route in Richmond.
