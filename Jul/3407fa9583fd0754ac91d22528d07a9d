Durban — Limpopo police are investigating the murder of a Further Education and Training teacher from KwaZulu-Natal who was burnt to death in a mob attack for allegedly being involved in stock theft. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi said the attack happened on Saturday at about 8am in the Lebowakgomo policing area. Seabi said the “barbaric murder of a male local educator is strongly denounced by the police management across the province.” “This emanates after the deceased was reportedly driving his motor vehicle in possession of an unknown number of goats that he purchased in Mamaolo, Ga-Mphahlele village,” Seabi said. “Unexpectedly, the victim's vehicle was stopped by a mob who pulled him outside of his motor vehicle. Afterwards, the victim was severely assaulted and burned to death together with his motor vehicle after being suspected of stock theft.” “Police were summoned to the scene and upon their arrival, they found a burnt-out bakkie and the victim lying a few metres, burned beyond recognition, away from the vehicle. The suspected stolen goats were not found at the scene of the crime,” Seabi continued. He said the teacher was from KwaZulu-Natal and lived in Lebowakgomo Zone A. Seabi cautioned residents not to take the law into their own hands but rather hand over the suspects to the police for investigation and prosecution. He said that a manhunt has since been launched for the suspects and anyone with information that can lead to their arrest is requested to contact the investigating officer, Sergeant Makadani on 072 029 7499 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or the nearest police station or MySAPS app. “Police investigations are continuing,” Seabi said.
