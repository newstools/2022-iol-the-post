Durban - The ANC in Moses Mabhida Region has welcomed the swift action of SAPS in the arrest of two suspects in connection with a tavern shooting in Sweetwaters, Pietermaritzburg, which left four people dead. In a statement yesterday, regional ANC spokesperson Njabulo Mtolo said according to reports received, the police were also able to locate the vehicle used in the crime in less than 48 hours. He said reports indicated that more arrests are imminent. “Certainly, there should be no stone left unturned in the efforts to apprehend every perpetrator involved in this barbarous act. This will undoubtedly contribute in restoring public confidence and trust in the work of our Police Service,” he said. Mtolo said the ANC reiterates its call for united action in the fight against the scourge of criminality that has engulfed communities. “We call on all our people to dedicate themselves in supporting and strengthening our street committees and CPFs, working together with the Police Service, to reclaim our streets,” he said. Mtolo extended the party’s deepest condolences to the bereaved families during this difficult period. “We also wish those admitted to the hospital, following this horrific incident, a speedy recovery,” he added.
