Durban — Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) has warned the public to be alert since a new gang has formed in the Verulam central business district targeting shoppers and motorists. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said several common robberies and theft out of motor vehicles had been reported in the past few days. Balram said hundreds of cases were reported and three suspects were eventually arrested by Rusa officers on June 30. He said two suspects were remanded in custody at Westville Prison for seven days. “The kingpin was believed to be a suspect sought for a murder. On their second appearance at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court both men were again remanded to Westville Prison awaiting trial,” Balram said. “They are considered dangerous and have attacked several victims stabbing them repeatedly with okapi knives. These weapons were recovered by officers during the arrest. A third suspect was released.” Balram said since the arrest, no stabbings have been reported in the central business district, however reaction officers have received information that a new gang is operating and targeting victims on Todd Street, Wick Street, Moss Street and Ireland Street. He said more updates would follow. Last month, before the arrest, Rusa had urged the public to be on high alert when entering the Verulam CBD following the spate of robberies and stabbings. After interviewing several victims and viewing CCTV footage from several businesses in the central business district, reaction officers singled out three men who were believed to be the perpetrators. All three suspects were allegedly found in possession of knives and stolen bank cards. The white T-shirt of the kingpin was allegedly found with blood stains. A 19-year-old victim who was stabbed several times on Todd Street identified the three men...  as the perpetrators that had attacked and robbed him. Then, police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo confirmed the arrest of two suspects for robbery. Daily News
