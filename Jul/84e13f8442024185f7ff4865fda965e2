Durban — A family came home from a visit to the mall to an unexpected visitor – a black mamba. Snake catcher Nick Evans said that on Sunday afternoon, while he and his wife were on their way back from the Aloe Festival in Ashburton after he had given a talk there, he received a call from the family and he told them he would be there soon, the snake “wasn’t going anywhere”. Evans said that the family had returned home from a trip to the Pavilion and found an unexpected surprise inside their home. He said that one of the family members saw a long black thing by her bedroom door. She thought maybe it was a belt, but was a bit nervous to go close, so she called another family member to look. The family member came, and quickly identified the object as a snake, a big one! It moved into the bedroom, so they shut the door behind it, trapping it. “As I opened the bedroom door, I spotted the mamba in the en-suite bathroom, across the room from me. It was draped over the sink!” “We approached it slowly. It was an interesting, slightly humorous sight. It looked quite a grumpy mamba, so I approached with extra caution. But it put up no resistance at all. I pinned it down with no hassle whatsoever,” Evans explained. “As I laid hands on it, I noticed it was freezing! The coldest mamba I've ever touched.” Evans said that perhaps the tiles in the house and bathroom were cold. It must have been inside for a few hours. He said the snake was about 2.2m in length. Evans also thanked the family for calling. Daily News
