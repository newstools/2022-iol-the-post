Durban - A 44-year-old man was handed a 20-year prison sentence for the rape of his girlfriend in March 2020 in the Bhekulwandle area near Umlazi in Durban. The man appeared for sentencing in the Umlazi Regional Court last week. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said the man was in a seven-year relationship with the woman and they share two children. She said the man often abused his partner and in January 2020 she ended their relationship. “On the day of the incident, he went to her house under the pretence of seeing their children but an argument soon ensued. He then strangled and raped her until she lost consciousness,” said Ramkisson-Kara. Ramkisson-Kara said the injured woman only woke the next morning and was unable to speak.  She said the man, who had remained at the house, apparently realising the extent of the woman’s injuries took her to hospital.  She said the woman communicated what happened to her to medical staff by writing on a piece of paper. The woman was attended to at the Thuthuzela Care Centre (an NPA-led one-stop rape crisis centre) based at Prince Mshiyeni Hospital where she accessed post trauma services, she said. According to Ramkisson-Kara, the woman had to undergo surgery due to the extent of the injuries she suffered from the rape. She said the man was sentenced to an effective 20 years imprisonment and he was declared unfit to possess a firearm. “While the State argued for life imprisonment, the court deviated to a lesser sentence as the man appeared remorseful in court. “Further, the court considered the fact that he assisted in taking the woman to hospital and that he supports their children, as compelling and substantial reasons to deviate from life imprisonment,” said Ramkisson-Kara.
