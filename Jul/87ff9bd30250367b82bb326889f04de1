Durban - Selected Home Affairs branches in KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country will close at 6pm from June 30 to July 15 to meet the expected demand over the school holidays. The extended operating hours were approved by Minister of Home Affairs Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. Ministerial spokesperson Siya Qoza said the extension of operating hours for the application and collection of Smart ID Cards and Passports excludes weekends. Qoza said the extension is to meet the anticipated increase in the demand for ID and passport services during the winter school holidays. He said during school holidays, the Department of Home Affairs experiences an increase in demand for its products, especially parents applying for various enabling documents for their children. “Parents are encouraged to use the Branch Appointment Booking System to schedule their visits to Home Affairs offices at times that are suitable to them,” said Qoza.

We will ensure that every client that is inside these selected offices at the time of closing receives services,” he said.
