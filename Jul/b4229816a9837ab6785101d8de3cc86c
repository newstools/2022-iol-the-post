Durban - KwaDukuza Mayor Lindile Nhaca has called for an investigation into the torching of a vehicle belonging to ward councillor Thubelihle Dube last week. The ward 10 councillor’s home was set on fire while the family was asleep, leaving his vehicle and parts of the house in Ezitendeni area, Groutville, destroyed. The KwaDukuza Municipality said the cause of the incident was unknown, however police are investigating a case of arson. “We are calling on law enforcement agencies to work together in order to determine the actual cause of the incident and act decisively against the perpetrators,” said Nhaca. Meanwhile, the mayor has also welcomed intervention against the illegal queueing system at the Home Affairs office in KwaDukuza. Nhaca commended the KwaDukuza Crime Prevention Unit for ensuring that the Home Affairs Office situated along Hullett Street is free from criminal elements as was reported in the media. “We commend KwaDukuza Municipality Crime Prevention Unit for ensuring that services at the Home Affairs Office go smoothly and without any form of criminality.  “We have received reports of intimidation by criminals who accept bribes just to position their clients first in the queue. This is unacceptable. We are also calling on the public to desist from paying for queue positions as this also perpetuates criminality. The issue of the Home Affairs office is a serious issue that requires mutual co-operation and urgent intervention from the department considering the conditions and its impact to society,” said Nhaca.
