In true service to mankind, there is no discrimination. “Dr Sooliman is a man of enormous distinction and integrity, and we are extremely  grateful for him to be our first peace award winner.” Speaking about the painting, artist Nanda Soobben said the painting features Sooliman and other struggle stalwarts, including Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko, Rahima Moosa, Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Sophie Williams,and Mahatma Gandhi, among others.  “Mr Sooliman is an inspiration, and his organisation’s work is evidence of this.” Soobben said the painting is aimed at promoting peace and took him about two weeks to complete.
