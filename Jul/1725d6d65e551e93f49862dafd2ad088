Durban - After a lengthy break, the Luthuli Walk will be hosted this Saturday in Groutville. It retraces the steps the late Chief Albert Luthuli walked from his home in Groutville to his shop and fields on the banks of the Umvoti River. The annual commemorative event is aimed at commemorating the passing of Chief Albert Luthuli on July 21, 1967. It takes place during the month of July to coincide with the date of his death. The Luthuli Museum, in partnership with the iLembe District Municipality, KwaDukuza Local Municipality, provincial Department of Sports and Recreation and Enterprise iLembe, said they were excited to announce the return of the Chief Albert Luthuli Annual Walk / Fun Run Walk. The event will take place on Saturday, July 23 from 7am in Groutville and registrations are open until July 21. The event has not taken place since 2019 due to the Covid-19 pandemic which restricted mass public events in consideration of people’s health and safety. The organisers said after the pandemic restrictions and devastation caused by the April floods, the walk was an opportunity to re-ignite the togetherness and passion for outdoor life and activities. This event caters for the avid runner/walker and novice with a 11km walk and 7.7km run on offer.  “This family fun event will include food stalls, chess games, music and other fun-filled activities catering for the young and old,” it said. The Luthuli Walk starts in front of the original 1927 house of Chief Albert and Mrs Nokukhanya Luthuli on 3233 Nokukhanya Luthuli Street in Groutville.  Tickets for the Walk are R100 and R120 for the Fun Run and R50 for pensioners. Further details and registration are available at www.luthuliwalk.org.za or contact 032 559 8147 for inquiries.
