Durban — A motorist’s vehicle was recovered after it was allegedly stolen by a suspect asking for directions at a business in Redhill, north of Durban. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said a motorist’s vehicle was recovered in Windermere after it had been stolen from their place of work in Redhill while helping a suspect who had asked for assistance with directions under false pretences. Powell said that at approximately 12pm on Wednesday, the Marshall Security Emergency Dispatch Centre was alerted via a WhatsApp crime group to the theft of a motor vehicle on Moreland Road.  “Details of the stolen motor vehicle were immediately dispatched to all our armed response officers and Special Operations team members to be on the lookout. “Reports from the scene indicated that a suspect had entered the business premises asking for directions. While staff members were assisting, the suspect stole one of their handbags which contained their cellphone and car keys.  “The suspect then proceeded to steal the staff member’s orange Kia Picanto and then fled the scene in an unknown direction.  “The victim only noticed a few minutes later that the theft had occurred, and the Greenwood Park SAPS were informed accordingly,” Powell said. The car owner proceeded to contact their tracking company to report the theft, and members of the Marshall Security Special Ops Team were activated by Matrix Tracking a few minutes later to assist with locating the stolen vehicle. “Within 13 minutes of tracking the vehicle, it was found abandoned and was successfully recovered by members of our Special Ops team, Matrix ground team and the SAPS Provincial Vehicle and Trio Task Team in a parking lot of a well-known shopping centre on Lilian Ngoyi Road in the Windermere area,” Powell said. He added that the scene was secured and would be investigated further by the police. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
