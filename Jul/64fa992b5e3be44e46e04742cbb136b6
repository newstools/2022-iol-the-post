Durban — Seven people have been killed in a fiery crash on the P291 between Nquthu and Babanango in northern KwaZulu-Natal. KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Mckenzie said the crash involved a minibus and a car. “Tragically seven people have sustained fatal injuries in this crash and paramedics from KZN Emergency Medical Services, together with their colleagues from a private ambulance service have transported 12 patients to hospital for continued medical care,” Mckenzie said. “One of these patients was in a critical condition while the remaining patients had sustained serious injuries.” Mckenzie said among the dead were six adults and one 12-year-old child. However, he was not sure of their gender. Mckenzie said the exact cause of the crash was unknown at this stage and is going to be investigated by the police. “However, we do know that both vehicles caught alight after the crash,” added Mckenzie. The police have been approached for comment. The mass fatality crash comes days after three crashes claimed the lives of at least 24 people in KZN over the weekend. Two separate crashes on the N11 outside Ladysmith are believed to have claimed 12 lives while one crash on the R617 near Mpophomeni also claimed 12 lives. Daily News
