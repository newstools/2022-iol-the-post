Durban - A joint crime intelligence operation led to the recovery of a stolen shipping container, stolen items and the arrest of three suspects in Darnall and KwaDukuza. Fidelity ADT said the container, which contained microwave ovens, was taken in Montclair in an apparent hijacking last week. Charnel Hattingh, head of communications and marketing at Fidelity ADT, said the shipping container was found in a rural industrial area.  “Teams involved in the operation included: Fidelity Specialised Intervention Unit (SIU), Ilembe Crime Intelligence, Taurus Security, KDM Rapid Response, McCarthy Risk, Umhlali SAPS Task Team, Bidvest Trading and KDZ Detectives,” said Hattingh.  Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the investigation led police to Doringkop where they found an empty container abandoned.  “The police proceeded to a market in Darnall, KwaDukuza where a sting operation was set up and two suspects aged 24 and 56 were arrested after they were found in possession of microwaves believed to be stolen property. “Further intelligence gathered led investigators to a liquor outlet and butchery in Doringkop where a third suspect aged 48 was arrested after he was found with unlicensed firearms, ammunition and 108 microwaves.” The suspects were also found with tyres and four sacks of face cream, which were also suspected to be stolen items. Investigations are ongoing to locate the remaining missing microwaves, Gwala said. The KwaDukuza Municipality has welcomed the arrests.  Kwadukuza Municipality mayor, Lindile Nhaca said: “We welcome the swift recovery of the goods and wish to commend the team that apprehended the three suspects. The intelligence driven joint operation by various law enforcement agencies reaffirms our long-standing commitment in the war that we have declared against criminality.” THE MERCURY
