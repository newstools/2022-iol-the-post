Durban - UMhlathuze Municipality say they are encouraged by the commitment to have the Package Plant Project completed by December.  The water project, set to benefit thousands of households in the Richards Bay area, including eSikhaleni, came into sharp focus at a recent meeting hosted by water entity Mhlathuze Water where there were questions raised about when the project was going to get under way.  At that meeting two weeks ago, City of uMhlathuze mayor Xolani Ngwezi challenged the water entity to conduct a site visit to determine the progress on the water project. In a statement on Sunday, the municipality said the mayor had met with the company hired to manufacture the plant equipment. It said the managing director of WEG Projects, the company contracted by the Mhlathuze Water Board to construct equipment for the 15 megalitre package plant, has committed to City of uMhlathuze mayor councillor X Ngwezi that the work would be done and completed by December.  “This package plant will add water supply in 15 wards of eSikhaleni, Dlangezwa, Felixton, Niwe and surrounding areas,” read the statement issued by the municipality on Sunday. The municipality also said Ngwezi has also committed to engage all relevant stakeholders about this breakthrough project.  The Mhlathuze Water spokesperson, Siyabonga Maphumulo, said they were happy a visit had been conducted to the site where the equipment was manufactured, as this provided clarity on the reasons behind delays.
