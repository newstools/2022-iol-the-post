Durban - The King Misuzulu Foundation (KMF), founded by King Misuzulu KaZwelithini in collaboration with Diageo South Africa, will take a trip to Nazaretha, Pinetown on Thursday for a follow-up visit to the families that were affected by the recent floods. He was among the first leaders to visit the flood-ravaged areas including Nazaretha in April and interacted with flood victims, offering them hope and galvanising support for their material needs.  “His Majesty the King felt that, two months after the devastation, it was a proper step to revisit the affected communities to assess how far they have gone in rebuilding their lives and also to see where he could further assist the victims. He then instructed the KMF to establish partnerships with various stakeholders, including the private sector, with a view to intervening in this tragedy,” said Terry Mdletshe, the chairman of the foundation. Diageo South Africa is the first company that has partnered with KMF in pursuit of the foundation’s chosen goals of community upliftment and addressing the challenges of poverty and unemployment. “When His Majesty’s foundation called on us to lend a helping hand to the affected communities in line with the values of shared humanity, we felt that as a company whose operations in the province was also devastated by the floods, we had a corporate duty to assist those who are less privileged. It is against this backdrop that we decided collaborate on this noble project,” said Sibani Mngadi of Diageo South Africa. Mdletshe added that rather than visit other communities, the king felt it was proper to return to the same community that he had visited in April.  “The view of His Majesty is that following up on one’s commitments is the best trait of leadership and he wants to lead by example in this regard.” THE MERCURY
