Durban - A motorist has been described as courageous on Facebook after she whipped out a slasher and chased off a man who opened her car door and attempted to steal from her in a video circulating on social media. The CCTV footage was posted of the Johannesburg incident in the eThekwini Secure Facebook group on Wednesday with the caption: “Well done Madam.” In the video a white vehicle is seen parked in a parking lot with other vehicles. A man wearing a blue long sleeve t-shirt and a cream coloured pants then approaches the vehicle and as he reaches the back of the car, he turns around and walks to the driver’s door. He looks through the window then quickly opens the door and leans inside the vehicle. He tussles with the driver for a couple seconds then runs away.   A woman jumps out of the car with a slasher, which is a cutting tool with a long sharp blade, and goes after the man. The woman then walks back to her car and jumps back inside the vehicle. A passenger is also seen jumping back in the car. In a clip at the end of the CCTV footage, the victim shows the slasher and she describes what happened.   She said the man opened her car and almost took her phone. The woman said she fought him off and hit him. She said the man did not get her phone and ran away. “Amadoda (men)… you guys must not play with me…,” she said. Commenting on the post one woman said: “Some women you don't mess with.” Another woman said: “And this is why I’ve got a cricket ball attached to a baseball bat. People must try me. I’m not shy to swing.” Others congratulated her on a job well done while others said the woman is “brave.” One Facebook user said such measures are necessary because women and children are targets while others offered more conservative advice. Another user advised the woman to lock her doors and another said: “Don’t be a sitting duck waiting for something to happen. Because that could’ve easily gone south. He was just an opportunist.” THE MERCURY
