Durban — While Inchanga police officer Mthokozisi Nene is fighting to be released on bail in the Camperdown Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, he also has to think about where he is going to sleep if granted bail because his home was torched allegedly by angry residents last week. Nene returns to the dock for his formal bail application and residents of the township west of Durban are expected to come out in numbers to picket the court to deny the application. He was arrested two weeks ago after allegedly shooting his wife, Thobeka Msomi-Nene, dead. The victim’s family who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Daily News on Wednesday morning that taxi operators have offered their taxis for free to transport locals to court to oppose bail for the accused. The relative said residents last week vented their anger at the offence by burning down the house where Nene allegedly killed his wife. “People are angry and decided to burn the accused’s house because they do not want him back here if he was granted bail. The situation is very tense,” said the relative. During his last appearance the State listed the accused’s safety as one of the reasons why it was opposed to bail. Another reason cited by State prosecutor Nokubongwa Mahlaba was that the accused may intimidate or influence witnesses since he knew them.  The wife, who was a teacher at Inchanga Primary School, was found dead with a bullet wound to her forehead. According to relatives, the husband allegedly shot her at close range after she objected to him sleeping with a girlfriend in their home.  The victim’s family claimed the accused was an abusive person who had been abusing the victim since he married her.
