Durban - eThekwini Municipality mayor Mxolisi Kaunda says by the end of the year the City would have delivered 148 new buses to Durban Transport to replace its ageing and unreliable fleet.  Last week, Kaunda unveiled 28 buses forming part of the new fleet to be delivered entirely by end of the year. The estimated cost for the 148 new buses is R380 million. Speaking at the launch, Kaunda said the new fleet will ensure that commuters, particularly the poor and working class, have access to safe, reliable and affordable public transport. Kaunda added that there are many factors including Covid-19 and the war between Ukraine and Russia, that created challenges in providing the new buses on time. “The new buses will replace the ageing and unreliable fleet which led to inconvenience for commuters as they would often not reach their destinations on time. Therefore, as a listening and caring government, we decided to embark on a process of replacing our old fleet,” he said. The mayor said the new fleet will improve the public transport system in the City and encourage more people to use public transport. Kaunda also pleaded with the community of eThekwini to protect and not vandalise the new buses, especially during service delivery protests. Earlier this year The Mercury reported that the municipality had taken steps to regain control of the municipal bus service that was being operated by private company Tansnat. THE MERCURY
