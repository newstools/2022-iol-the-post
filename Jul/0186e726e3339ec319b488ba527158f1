Durban - Marshall Security said an alleged armed robbery suspect, who was apprehended last week in La Lucia, could only be charged for possession of a dangerous weapon as the robbery victims could not be traced. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said, on Thursday night at about 7:30pm, the Emergency Dispatch Centre was notified about an armed robbery on Armstrong Avenue in La Lucia. “The suspect was armed with a knife and (allegedly) robbed two females of their guest house keys but was disturbed by a member of the public, who notified our teams that the suspect had fled the scene in an unknown direction,” said Powell. Powell said multiple members and teams were alerted and were on the lookout for the suspect. He said, just a few minutes later, the suspect was spotted on Davallen Avenue by an armed response officer. “Together with our street patrol guard and members of our special ops team, the suspect was immediately arrested,” he said. Powell said upon searching the alleged suspect, a knife was found in his possession. “The member of the public who witnessed the robbery arrived on scene and positively identified the suspect,” he said. According to Powell, efforts were made to find the victims of the armed robbery, but they could not be located. “The Durban North SAPS were contacted and arrived on the scene a short while later. The suspect was then detained and charged for being in possession of a dangerous weapon,” he said. Powell said it was unfortunate that a case of armed robbery could not be opened due to the victims of the crime not being found. “We urge all members of the public, no matter how minor or severe a crime is, to please report the matter to the SAPS,” he said. Powell added that the suspect was a vagrant in the La Lucia area and often sold avocados to the public on Armstrong Avenue. THE MERCURY
