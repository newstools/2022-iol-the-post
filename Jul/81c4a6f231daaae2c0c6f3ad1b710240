Durban — The matter of three men arrested with copper cables worth R1 million in the Umhlali policing area was remanded to August 2 for a formal bail application. National Prosecuting Authority KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said Ashlen Govender, Thembinkosi Khumalo and Mohamed James appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s on Monday on charges of possession of suspected stolen property and tampering with essential infrastructure. The three were arrested on Friday, July 22, after they were found in possession of 18 cellphone tower batteries and 614kg of Telkom, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, Transnet cables with an estimated value of R1 million. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said police had received intelligence about an illegal scrap metal dealer operating at Shakaskraal in the Umhlali policing area. On Friday at 11.20am, a multidisciplinary joint operation was put in place after police had conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of the identified premises.

It was established that the business was indeed operating illegally. “Copper cables which belonged to Transnet were recovered and weighed 614.5kg.
