Durban — Two accused escaped with fines for dealing and cultivating cannabis plants on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. Ryan McDermid, 34, and Domonique Peres, 35, were sentenced by the Durban Regional Court on June 27 for dealing and cultivating cannabis plants. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said that in January 2018, members from Port Shepstone Serious Organised Crime Investigation working together with other law enforcement agencies conducted a search of the accused’s premises. “During the search, more than 2 000 cannabis plants were confiscated at various premises around the South Coast,” Mhlongo said. “The premises were set up as an indoor-type cannabis grow house and equipment used to cultivate and dry the plant material was confiscated. As a result, the laboratories were successfully dismantled. “A number of accused were identified and arrested in various places.” Mhlongo said the suspects were charged accordingly and were released on bail. “McDermid was sentenced to pay a fine of R50 000 or three years imprisonment. He was further sentenced to five years imprisonment which is suspended for five years,” Mhlongo said. He said Peres was sentenced for dealing in cannabis. “He was sentenced to pay a fine of R20 000 or serve two years’ imprisonment. The state has forfeited three farms and one motor vehicle to the value of R3 700 000.” Daily News
