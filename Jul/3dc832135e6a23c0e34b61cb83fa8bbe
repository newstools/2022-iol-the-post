Durban – The eThekwini Municipality has cautioned residents in the Birchwood Park area in Pinetown to take precautionary measures when using tap water. On Monday, the municipality issued a public notice after test results indicated that potable water in Birchwood Park was not of good quality. “Residents are urged to first boil for a minute to make it safe for consumption,” the municipality said. “The municipality has taken immediate action by isolating the reservoir with a team flushing the pipes as part of sanitation processes.” “Interruption of water supply is also expected in the area while remedial work is under way.” The municipality said that affected residents would be notified if the laboratory released further information. “The municipality assures residents that water quality across the rest of the city is not affected.
