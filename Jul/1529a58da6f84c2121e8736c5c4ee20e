Durban - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has rejected Eskom’s proposed 32.7% tariff increase application and calls on the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to refuse this increase. The NFP says it notes with utter disdain the audacity of Eskom to want to increase its tariffs by 32.7%. This proposal comes in the wake of perpetual load shedding, which the party says at its peak wiped R4 billion from the GDP, for each day it occurred. NFP MP Ahmed Munzoor Shaik-Emam said despite Eskom’s inability to deliver its services with consistency and quality, it now wants South Africans to pay more money for less electricity. “This proposal comes in the wake of S&P Global Ratings stating that Eskom may need an additional R45 billion. “Eskom’s dismal failure to prevent load shedding, is now being shifted to the consumer. South Africans not only have to bear the burden of Eskom ineffectiveness through load shedding, but also through the increased cost of electricity,” stated Shaik-Emam. NFP says many South Africans are struggling to make ends meet. “As such, an additional high tariff increase will result in greater poverty and unemployment. “The NFP calls on Nersa to reject Eskom’s tariff application; and for President Cyril Ramaphosa to immediately intervene with a clear plan, which doesn’t shift the burden to the South African citizen who is already struggling to make ends meet,” he said.
