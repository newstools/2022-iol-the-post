Durban - The number of people who died in the Mpophomeni R617 accident has risen to 12 after one of the passengers from the mini bus taxi succumbed to his injuries in hospital on on Sunday. In the early hours of Sunday, 11 people were reported to have died in a multi-vehicle collision, including a police officer who was directing traffic following an accident on the R617 in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. Midlands EMS spokesperson Roland Robertson said Midlands EMS Howick advanced life support ambulances were dispatched to the R617 just after 9.30pm. According to one of the survivors Njabulo Hlongwane, who was one of two occupants from the mini bus taxi, they were headed back to uMlazi south of Durban after attending an event in Mpendle. Hlongwane said one of his friends jumped out of the moving taxi and succumbed to his injuries. A Toyota Hilux, a taxi, police van and security vehicle were involved in the crash. Robertson said when paramedics arrived, they were met with a gruesome scene. He said the accident scene stretched about 200m on the road. “It is alleged that there was a motor vehicle accident on the corner when a taxi lost control, hitting the barrier causing a secondary accident with other vehicles and SAPS members,” said Robertson. The KZN Department of Transport, Community Safety Acting MEC Jomo Sibiya visited the families of dead police officer Sergeant Sizwe Madondo and of the security guards who also perished on the scene. Family members of the occupants of the mini bus taxi who died travelled from uMlazi to identify their loved ones.     THE MERCURY
