DURBAN – Stolen goods and cash were recovered after a high-speed chase between reaction officers and robbery suspects in Pietermaritzburg this week. According to security company, Mi7 National Group, their officers were approached by a security guard who reported that an armed robbery had taken place at a petrol station convenience store on Commercial Road just before 9pm on Wednesday. The guard reported that three culprits, travelling in a white Toyota Etios, had robbed the convenience store and fled in the vehicle. “Mi7 Reaction officers immediately got to work, with teams strategically scouting the area for a vehicle matching the description.
