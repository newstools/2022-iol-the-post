Durban — Mobi-Claw 911, a local emergency services company, went beyond the call of duty to assist a client’s father who was suspected of having a heart attack while on holiday in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Mobi-Claw 911 reported that a 55-year-old man had suffered a heart attack at a remote Midlands resort on Wednesday. Mobi-Claw 911 spokesperson Mike Myers said that around 8pm that night, the company received an alert from their client who reported that they were at a holiday resort in the KZN Midlands and he suspected that his father was having a heart attack. Myers said their incident manager activated the incident on their MC911 Cyber Control™ management system which immediately identifies the closest accredited emergency medical service. “Midlands EMS was dispatched and was quickly on the scene. The patient was stabilised on the scene before being transported by ambulance to a private hospital,” Myers said. “Thank you Midlands EMS for your quick and efficient response.” Speaking to the Daily News on Monday, Myers said it was not a heart attack but an underlying illness the client had. The company reached out to the family and learned that the client was doing better. Commenting on the company doing more for their client, Myers said: “We operate across the country. We help anyone in need of medical, fire or criminal assistance - that’s what we do.” “We try hard. We save a lot of lives. We enjoy helping people,” added Myers. Daily News
