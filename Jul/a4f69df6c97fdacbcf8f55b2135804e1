Durban - The DA in KwaZulu-Natal is conducting oversight inspections at community halls housing flood victims, who are awaiting temporary housing. The DA KZN Leader, Francois Rodgers, is undertaking the inspections along with DA KZN spokesperson on Social Development, Mmabatho Tembe, DA KZN spokesperson on Human Settlements, Marlaine Nair and other councillors. The DA says while the provincial government has been slow in building units for residents, they continue to live in inhumane conditions. “From our first day and after having seen these conditions ourselves, we will approach the South African Human Rights Commission regarding the conditions in some of these halls,” said Rodgers. On Wednesday they were set to visit Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, Palmiet L-zone Clare Estate, Truro Hall in Westville and Sub 5 Community Hall in Kwadabeka. Last month KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala announced plans to build temporary residential units alongside permanent high-rise flats for flood victims of the Annet Drive informal settlement in Reservoir Hills. According to Zikalala, there are eight sites identified to build temporary residential units (TRUs) in eThekwini Metro with three in the North Region and five in the West Region.  He said the province was able to start delivery of 1 074 TRUs as part of the first phase. KZN Department of Human Settlement spokesperson Mbulelo Baloyi says to date, 563 temporary housing units have been built. THE MERCURY
