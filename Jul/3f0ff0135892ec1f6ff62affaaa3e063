Durban -- FOLLOWING the tragic loss of a zebra at the Bisley Nature Reserve in Pietermaritzburg  last month, due to a poaching incident, Durban hiking clubs rallied with the Friends of Bisley Nature Reserve (FoBNR) to locate and remove snares. Last week, two Durban hiking clubs, In Your Footsteps and Adventure Hikers, travelled to the nature reserve to look for and remove snares, said a statement. Grant Geoghegan from In Your Footsteps and Elvira Wortman from Adventure Hikers, along with fellow Durban resident Jenz Wells, contacted FoBNR’s project lead on anti-poaching and security, Jason Stakemire, to arrange the event. The statement said 25 people travelled up from Durban on Sunday morning and, following a briefing from Stakemire, they were divided up into groups to patrol potential hotspot areas within the reserve, each led by a member of the FoBNR team. “The morning was successful with several newly placed snares located and removed, each of which would no doubt have led to the suffering and loss of an animal,” it said. Stakemire said plans were being discussed with the groups to make this a regular event. “It is fantastic to have people coming from as far as Durban to help protect Bisley’s animals,” he said. He also urged anyone interested to follow Friends of Bisley Nature Reserve’s Facebook page to keep up to date with the happenings in the reserve and for any groups or individuals interested in helping with future patrols to email bnrpatrols@gmail.com After the event, the volunteers gathered in the picnic area for brunch. According to the statement, FoBNR have recently marked recommended birding, cycling, and hiking trails within the reserve for visitors. It said an official launch event is currently in the planning stages. “A large map will be installed at the Canterbury gate parking area in the near future,” said the statement.      THE MERCURY
