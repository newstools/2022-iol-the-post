Durban — In what sounded like a scene similar to the famous Final Destination film franchise, a woman was left injured when a piece of metal broke off a logging truck, striking her. Midlands EMS spokesperson Roland Robertson said their crews received a call for an accident on the Old Greytown Road near Prilla. Robertson said that when paramedics arrived, they found a 33-year-old woman had been involved in a freak accident. “While the lady was walking next to the road, a large piece of metal broke off a logging truck that was driving past and struck her. “She was found to have sustained serious injuries and advanced life support was needed to treat and stabilise her,” he said. Robertson said she was then rushed to a local facility for further treatment. He added that authorities were on scene and had started an investigation. Daily News
