Durban — Construction work on the railway lines  between Reunion and Isipingo train stations is currently under way to prepare for the return of train operations to the south of Durban. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) is expected to resume operations on September 1 to Umlazi and the south coast. Trains on the south and northern lines in Durban had been out of operation since the April floods after the infrastructure was severely damaged. Provincial spokesperson for Prasa, Zama Nomnganga, told the Daily News on Wednesday that restoration of railways lines that were damaged by the devastating floods was under way. He said they completed repairs between Isipingo and Reunion train stations, and the teams would move to Merebank and other stations on the south coast. Trains on the south and northern lines in Durban had been closed since the April floods after the infrastructure was severely damaged. The news of trains returning is expected to bring much-needed relief to the commuters who had to pay extra in mini-bus taxi and bus fares which have since increased because of the fuel costs. The return of trains is also expected to boost small businesses like fruit and vegetable vendors.  They had to close their businesses because of the halted operations. One of the vendors, Siyabulela Dlamini, who runs a fruit and vegetable kiosk at the Umlazi railway station, said the floods affected his livelihood because he fed his family with the income he was getting from his kiosk. “We are happy to see construction work taking place because it means trains will return to operations soon. We cannot wait for them to resume. This is our only source of income. If there are no train commuters, we are at a loss,” said Dlamini. Daily News
