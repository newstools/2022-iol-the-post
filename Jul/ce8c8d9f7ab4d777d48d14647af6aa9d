Durban - By the end of this year, eThekwini Municipality will be cleaner than Msunduzi (Pietermaritzburg), says deputy mayor Philani Mavundla. Mavundla took a pot shot at Msunduzi Municipality – which over the years has become known for its state of uncleanliness – during a gala dinner event where he presented his committee's budget on Thursday last week. Mavundla chairs the Human Settlements and Infrastructure service committee. The committee is charged with many functions, including the cleanliness of eThekwini. “I promise you, by the end of this year, eThekwini will be cleaner than Msunduzi,” said Mavundla, eliciting laughter and clapping from those attending the gala event. Business and councillors in Msunduzi, which is the capital of the province and home to the provincial legislature, have frequently complained about the state of the city.  “The (provincial legislature) will have to decide if they (want)  to continue being in Pietermaritzburg or if they want to move,” said Mavundla. In an further remark, Mavundla added that while travelling around the country he had noticed that the DA-run areas, especially Cape Town, was very clean. “Those who don't like the DA must like the fact that it's clean in Cape Town, that is a fact that we cannot run away from, it's the truth.  “And we would like to see eThekwini at that level, not far from now, by the end of this year, we should have reached that level,” he said.
