Durban - Four suspects who are believed to be part of a group of criminals who robbed a jewellery store at a Westville shopping centre last month were arrested. The Mercury reported last month that 10 brazen robbers stormed a jewellery store at a Westville shopping centre and made off with jewellery and a box of vouchers. Marshall Security spokesperson Tyron Powell said the suspects had been involved in several incidents of robbery in Durban. Powell said at around 12:30 pm, members of Marshall’s Special Operations Team, SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit, SAPS Crime Intelligence and Business Against Crime received information related to the Westville shopping centre robbery on June 30. He said a silver Toyota Corolla Quest that was allegedly involved in the jewellery store robbery at the shopping centre was spotted travelling on Inanda Road. Members immediately acted on information received and proceeded to investigate, he said. “While on Inanda Road the said vehicle was spotted by the members, who then managed to stop the vehicle and arrest four suspects inside,” he said. Powell said numerous household items, fake registration numbers and housebreaking implements were also found inside the vehicle. “It was also later confirmed that it was the same vehicle that had been involved in the (Westville shopping centre) robbery, as well as additional incidents at a cellphone shop in (Musgrave) and a business in Riverside Road,” he said. He said the scene was secured and will be investigated further by the SAPS.    THE MERCURY
