Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality is clamping down on businesses and traders accused of violating its by-laws. This past weekend the municipality conducted a blitz, targeting businesses and suspected illegal traders along Berg and Retief Streets in the city centre, to determine if these businesses are complying with the municipality’s by-laws. In a statement posted on its Facebook, the municipality said: “This week we visited businesses along Berg and Retief Street as part of the ongoing blitz exercise to investigate if businesses are in compliance with the municipal by-laws. “Illegal connection of electricity was a major issue which led to multiple disconnections. Goods were also confiscated from street vendors operating without a street trading licence. “The municipality is taking legal action against businesses failing to comply with the by-laws. More and more businesses are now coming forward to regularise their operations,” it said. It said it had visited a total of 58 premises, of which 18 were food premises. It issued 8 notices, 11 summons were issued and 10 condemnations notices. The state of the province’s capital city has come under fire from several quarters in recent months. In May, mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla unveiled a plan to tackle inner city decay and address the issue of problem buildings in the CBD as part of his budget speech. He said the municipality has looked at specific roles it must play in arresting the decay, including that relevant laws and by-laws should be strictly enforced.  THE MERCURY
