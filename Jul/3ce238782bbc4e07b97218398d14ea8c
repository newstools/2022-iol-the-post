Durban — A private security company apprehended two suspects posing as police reservists while attempting to rob a man in Pietermaritzburg. Mi7 National Group spokesperson Colin David said that on Friday evening, their control room received a distress call from a Northdale client reporting that two suspects were attempting to rob a man outside the client's premises. David said that their armed response units were dispatched to the location and through quick response, their reaction officers found the suspects still at the scene. “It is believed the pair had been posing as police reservists, stopping members of the public under that pretext before robbing them,” David said. “Along with their counterparts from another security company, Mi7 reaction officers apprehended the suspects and found in their possession two knives, which were confiscated.” David added that the matter was handed over to the police for further investigation. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
