Durban — Three men are expected to appear in court on Monday after they were arrested with copper cables worth R1 million in the Umhlali policing area. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said police received intelligence about an illegal scrap metal dealer operating at Shakaskraal in the Umhlali policing area. On Friday at 11.20am, a multidisciplinary joint operation was put in place after police had conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of the identified premises. Gwala said the team swooped on the scrapyard and an inspection was conducted. It was established that the business was indeed operating illegally. “Copper cables which belonged to Transnet were recovered and weighed 614.5kg. A further search was conducted and 18 cellphone tower batteries were found concealed in a bag. The total value of the recovered property is estimated at R1m,” Gwala said. She said the three men aged between 34 and 36 were arrested for the possession of stolen property and tampering with essential infrastructure. “The docket has been transferred to the Hawks who took over the investigation,” Gwala said. She said the suspects were expected to appear before the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Members of the community are urged to report criminal activities to police via Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or the MySAPS app. Daily News
