Durban — Two people were killed when the bakkie they were travelling in crashed in Chatsworth, south of Durban, on Saturday night. Amawele Emergency Services rushed to the scene and spokesperson Claude Subramodey said the incident happened just after 10.30pm. Subramodey said the service was called out to the Havenside off-ramp. “The accident response unit arrived on scene within minutes to find that one bakkie is believed to have lost control and flipped multiple times, landing on its roof in a river,” Subramodey said. “Paramedics found two males lying metres apart; sadly both patients had no signs of life and were declared dead on the scene.” Subramodey said their bodies were handed over to the police for further investigations. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
