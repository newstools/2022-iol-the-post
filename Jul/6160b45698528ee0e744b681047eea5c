Durban — KwaZulu-Natal law enforcement is cracking down on copper theft in the province. Over the weekend, Hawks officers from Newcastle Serious Organised Crime Investigation working together with Kingsley Visible Policing members arrested four people accused of the possession of stolen copper cables. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said members received information about people allegedly loading copper cables into a vehicle at Mealie Field, Roodekoppe Farm. “A joint operation was swiftly conducted and the four were arrested.”  Police found copper cables with a street value of R400 000 and they were positively identified by a Transnet technician, Mhlongo said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Utrecht Magistrate’s Court. The Hawks had not responded on the outcome of the court appearance by the time of publication. Daily News
