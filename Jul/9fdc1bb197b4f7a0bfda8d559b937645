Durban — Tributes are pouring in for Durban Community Policing Forum (CPF) stalwart Muhammed Sayed Adam who was laid to rest on Saturday. Adam, also known as Sam Adam, grew up in Wentworth, south of Durban, and later relocated to a housing complex known as Galway in Mayville where he began several community upliftment projects. Adam also owned a tuckshop in the complex and adopted a neglected portion of the land to create a park for the community. He also took on the responsibility of cleaning the park which also had a waterfall. Adam was also part of several CPFs in Durban and at one stage was the chairperson of the Mayville CPF. Active Citizens Coalition councillor Imtiaz Syed, in a tribute, said Adam was to many a source of inspiration and a father figure with an immense sense of protection, love and inspiration with the clearest, heartiest care unrewarded but extremely felt. “In the 5 minutes that I used to pop into the backroom of his shop in Bristow Crescent walking out feeling empowered by a father's encouragement, is all it really did to spur me on in the path of life I now call my own. “When reflecting on the impact of many positive mentors I have had in life, Sam always ranks at the top with all of the fathers I have. As we have grown in our spaces from body corporates to CPFs, to a general sense of activism.” Syed added, that for him, Adam was extremely instrumental in his every step, always with an encouraging word and saying “I am so proud of you, and you do us proud which gave us the spirit to spear ahead. “All the good we do for humanity, may Adam always be the beneficiary of it as would my father. “Sam you have done well, and you will reap the rewards simply for the pure person you have always been and may you be rewarded for it,” Syed concluded. Close friend Lawrence Palmer said, “Uncle Sam was a friend to so many people, a man with a big heart for the community. A giant and legend indeed. Rest in perfect peace uncle Sam.” Daily News
