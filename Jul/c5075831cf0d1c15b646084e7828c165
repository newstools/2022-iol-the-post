Durban — KwaZulu-Natal Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi was in Nquthu and eDumbe as part of her Mandela Day celebrations. Sithole-Moloi was in the two areas on Monday to honour Nelson Mandela and to promote projects inspired by his achievements. In eNquthu, Sithole-Moloi visited Qedusizi Primary School to plant vegetables such as cabbages, chillies and spinach before proceeding to eDumbe to repaint the school walls. EDumbe resident Delisiwe Chiliza said: “As residents, we are delighted to have members of government in our hometown and we appreciate the MEC’s thought of removing all garbage and clutter within our school, which has been in a very unpleasant condition for some time. We urge learners and other community members to uphold the importance of hygiene within the school premises for it to be beneficial even to future generations.” Sithole-Moloi said: “It gives me great joy to see over 100 volunteers coming out in numbers to support and celebrate the life of the great Dr Nelson Mandela. We urge everyone to continue doing good to uplift the lives of our people.” Sithole-Moloi is expected to contest for the deputy secretary position at the KZN ANC policy conference over the weekend.
